Implementations
================


Language: Ada
--------------------------------

Ada is an interesting language in that it has many similarities with C.
I had never used a language that had procedures in addition to functions.
In implementing the recursive funcitonality of prime_partitions we had issues
with being able to append to the vector passed in. We fixed this by creating
a copy of the vector to which we appended the next layer.
There are no known bugs that we know of other than the spacing of the output
being non-ideal.
Positive aspects of our project is that it works and we use vectors to manage
the partitions. I know of others who use a large array that has the potential
to be a waste of memory.
We used vectors in Ada rather than an array because it is easily made larger
with appended items, while an array would have to be a finite length.

![Ada Screenshot](./ada/screenshot.png)



Language: OCaml
--------------------------------

Ocaml was unique in that all the functions we made had to be recursive.
One thing that I thought was odd was the "@" used to append to a list.
Also the declaration of types to me did not seem very intuitive.
Loops were also strange in that we had to define them ourselves.
Lastly it was neato to only have to "import" Printf.
The only negative aspect of our program is when a non-integer is inputed
in order to exit it exits via an exception exit.
Positive aspects include that it works, and the implementation does not use
any "hacky" implementation.
A list was used in order to manage the prime partitions in order to be able
to resize and append to the structure.
This implementation I would say is likely very similar to that of others.

![OCaml Screenshot](./ocaml/screenshot.png)

Language: Rust
--------------------------------
Rust was unique in that there was a lot of code used to just unwrap and handle
the integer input that was passed into prime_partitions. Also the declaration
of variable types is interesting in that the delcaration of i32 is needed to
specify a 32bit integer.
The only negative aspect I can think of would be that the exit protocol involves
the invalid digit exception in the read_line funciton, but that error code is
handled.
The positive aspect of our program is that it works and we use a vector in order
to append and resize.
Our implementation is similar to that of our ada and perl implementation.

![Rust Screenshot](./rust/screenshot.png)

Language: Perl
--------------------------------
Perl is unique in that everyhting is returned in a list and the variables
need to be inpereted by "shift" the items off the list.
This Perl implementation is also one of our shorter/cleaner implementations.
There are no known negative aspects of our program that I am aware of.
A positive aspect of our implementation is that it works and exits cleanly upon
the entering of a non integer value.
This implementation is rather straight forward and similar to that of the
Python.

![Perl Screenshot](./perl/screenshot.png)

Language: Prolog
--------------------------------

Prolog is my least favorite language!
I do have to say that it is neat how it stores return variables and they need
to be viewed in the results.
I really hate the ";" that is used in else statements. I find it very
non-intuitive and hard to read. I also don't like the way Prolog handles type
declaration. I also don't like that prolog function assignment ":-" looks like a
penis. It's the same for assignments in Ada. Perhaps that's what the "log" in
"Prolog" represents.
A negative aspect of our program is that when you input an integer and want to
see all of the prime partitions you have to press the ";" key while it poops out
the next resulting partition one at a time until it runs out of results.
A positive aspect of our program is that it works and is clean in it's
execution.
We use arrays to store the partitions.

![Prolog Screenshot](./prolog/screenshot.png)

Language: Scheme (extra credit)
--------------------------------

Scheme looks similar to Bash.
While most of the other languages did not use many "[]" or "()" Scheme does.
We use a list to store resulting partitions.
It's nice that we don't have to import anything to do math or input in Scheme.
No negatives that I know of.
Positive aspects include that it works.
This approach was done similar to that of the Python implementation.
I don't like the lack of returns or clear variable assignments.

THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE
Screenplay by Brandon Mau & Aubrey Stafford
Based on a screenplay by
Tobe Hooper & Kim Henkel
REVISED FINAL DRAFT
8/11/03

FADE IN:

ON A DARK SCREEN.

MUSIC RISES as we see a scroll of red lettering rise
up from the bottom of the screen and disappear into
the top of the screen. A narrator reads it as it
does.

		NARRATOR
On August 20th, 1973, police were dispatched to the
remote farmhouse of Thomas Hewitt, a former head
skinner at the local slaughterhouse in Travis County,
Texas. What they found within the confines of his
cryptic residence was the butchered remains of 33
victims, a chilling discovery that shocked and
horrified a nation in which many still call the most
gruesome mass murder case of all time. The film that
you are about to see is the shocking truth of what
happened to five young friends who were traveling
down that lonely country highway in Travis County,
Texas. Now, for the first time, the only known
survivor of that terrifying day has broken the
silence, and has come forward to tell the truth of
what really happened on that deserted road when the
group suddenly found themselves being stalked by a
chainsaw wielding madman who would leave a trail of
blood and terror that would forever be known as The
Texas Chainsaw Massacre...

Soon after, the CREDITS BEGIN TO ROLL in dark yellow
lettering as we see

A MONTAGE OF FAST MOVING CLIPS.

The clips are of old and decayed bodies. Other noises
can be heard in the background, such as screaming,
laughter, and the buzzing of a loud chainsaw. One
final scream can be heard as the CREDITS END and we

EXT. TRAVIS COUNTY POLICE STATION_RAINING_NIGHT

SUPERIMPOSE:

AUGUST 20TH, 1973

INT. HALLWAY_TRAVIS COUNTY POLICE STATION_SAME

Doctors and policemen walk around quietly. A single
policeman turns a corner and heads down another
hallway. At the end of the hallway is a door. A young
man wearing a white doctors suit stands next to it.
The policeman walks towards the door and the young
man. Then, another police officer steps out and
stands face-to-face with the first policeman we had
seen before. They both walk to the side and look back
at the door.

		POLICEMAN
So?

		POLICEMAN #2
Nothing. She's not talking.

		POLICEMAN
She's not saying anything?

		POLICEMAN #2
She won't talk to anyone. I doubt you're going to get
anything out of her.

		POLICEMAN
I can try. I'm not giving up on this girl. I want all
the facts. Keep all those damn reporters outside,
alright? That's your job from now on.

The second policeman nods and walks away. The
policeman looks back at him and then makes his way
towards the door. The man standing next opens the
door for him and the policeman steps inside of it.
The door slams shut in front of the CAMERA.

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM_(CONT.)

Inside is a single table sitting in the middle of the
room, along with a single light bulb hanging from a
cord above it. Sitting at the table is ERIN HARDESTY,
a young girl of seventeen. She is very pretty and
smart, but right now, she is shaking severely. Her
wet hair sits in front of her face...covering it. The
policeman sits in a chair across from her.

Silence.

		POLICEMAN
Erin?

Erin looks down, scared. She starts to cry silently.

		POLICEMAN
Erin, you have to talk to us. You have to tell us
exactly what happened...

Erin tries to say something but can't. She stutters.

		ERIN
(crying)
No...

		POLICEMAN
Erin, you have to.

		ERIN
(stuttering)
I...I...I can't...

		POLICEMAN
No one's here but us. No one is going to hurt you in
any way. All I want to know are the facts. Just tell
me everything that happened. We'll take you home
after this, I promise.

Erin shakes her head. The policeman sighs. He takes
out a single tape recorder and sets it on top of the
table. She looks up and sniffs.

		POLICEMAN
Please.

Erin looks down and cries. We can tell that the
policeman is getting very upset. He closes his eyes
and sighs silently.

		POLICEMAN
No one's here, Erin...No one's going top hurt
you...You have to talk to me...

The policeman presses a single button on the tape
recorder. Erin looks up. She pulls her hair back and
sets her hands in her lap. She wipes her tears and
sighs. Slowly, we

FADE TO:

EXT. LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_DAY

SUPERIMPOSE:

AUGUST 18TH, 1973

There is no sound. The sun is larger than the frame
and white-hot. A long, golden arc sweeps across the
upper right hand corner; it is the explosive, gaseous
profile of the sun. There is a burst of light and a
liquid rope of molten gases arcs into space and then
slowly, heavily falls back to the sun.

The yellow-white sun nearly fills the frame. There is
a low, crackling noise. The sun begins to dissolve
and to become an eye, the purple glazed eye of a dead
dog. Flies swarm the staring eye and the crackling
noise becomes the buzzing of the flies.

In the extreme foreground and to the right of center
is the long dead and putrid carcass of a dog. The
lower jaw, nearly ripped from the head, hangs wildly
askew. The belly is a living, writhing mass of gray
maggots; flies swarm the purple, glazed eyes. The
carcass lies some feet from the shoulder of a narrow,
chuckhole two-lane highway. It is midday and
midsummer and the brutal southwestern sun blasts the
dusty, chocking landscape. The air is still and
heavy. In the background is the out of focus image of
a van.

Slowly, it comes closer and closer to the CAMERA.
Suddenly, it zooms past us very quickly. We stare at
the empty road for a few seconds. We pan down to the
dog once again.

INT. VAN_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_DAY

The van looks much better on the inside than it does
on the outside. In the back of the van is nothing but
a collection of old records, an old mattress lying on
the ground, a cooler, and bottles of half drunken
water. Behind the back of the mattress lie many bags
of marijuana and weed.

As we look around, we see five teenagers in the van.
Sitting in the passenger's seat is ERIN, the same
girl from the police station, only now, she is
looking much prettier and cleaned up. She also wears
a white cowboy hat and eats a small carrot stick.

As we look past at her tie-die t-shirt, we see a
belly button piercing on her stomach. Driving is her
boyfriend, KEMPER STERLING, a young, somewhat
attractive boy of eighteen.

Sitting in the backseat is ANDY PARTAIN, a young boy
of eighteen. He is a very handsome and smart boy.

In his arms is his girlfriend, PEPPER HARRINGTON, a
very pretty and smart girl of about his age. Pepper
sits on top of Andy's lap while they both kiss and
hug.

Sitting on the floor in the back of the van is Erin's
brother, MORGAN HARDESTY. He is a very smart and
handsome boy. The group looks up to him for any help
that they might need, but he's something of an
asshole. He reads a magazine while Andy and Pepper
make their way to the mattress and continue to kiss.

Erin reaches her hand up towards Kemper's face and
smiles. He grabs her hand and kisses it. She smiles
and looks into his eyes.

		KEMPER
Tell me how much you love me.

Erin brings her pointer finger very close to her
thumb. They are barely touching.

		ERIN
(laughs)
This much.

		KEMPER
Bullshit!

Erin laughs and pretends to stick her tongue out in
disgust. She widens her fingers.

		ERIN
This much.

		KEMPER
(mimics)
This much?

		ERIN
That much.

Kemper widens his finger so he can't widen it any
longer.

		KEMPER
(laughs)
This much?!

Erin laughs and pulls down his hand. She holds it and
looks at him. The both come close to eachother and
close their eyes. They kiss. Morgan stands up and
reaches his hand over to the air conditioning,
pulling Erin and Kemper apart.

		ERIN
Morgan you ass!

		MORGAN
What? It's hot in here. I'm just trying to get a
little cool.

		KEMPER
I'm afraid the air conditioning won't help. It's like
hell out there.

		ERIN
(to Morgan)
Well could you do it when Kemper and I are not so
close together, please?

		MORGAN
That would be impossible.

Morgan grabs Erin's carrot sticks and bites it. He
smiles and shows his gleaming white teeth. Erin
smacks him. He sits back down and goes back to
reading his book. He looks up from his book at Andy
and Pepper, who seem to be enjoying themselves.
Pepper pulls herself away from Andy and they both
breathe hard. They are covered in sweat. Pepper
smiles while Andy leans on his side.

		PEPPER
(breathing hard)
You...are...incredible.

		ANDY
(also breathing hard)
This is the first breath I've taken since this trip
began...You are a sex machine.

		PEPPER
I take pride in my work.

They both lie down on their sides and look into
eachother's eyes.

		PEPPER
Tell me you love me.

		ANDY
You mean you haven't gotten tired of it yet?

Pepper puts her pointer finger on Andy's lips and
laughs.

		PEPPER
Nope.

She pulls her finger away. He smiles and looks at her
once again. A long moment of silence.

		ANDY
I love you.

		PEPPER
(smiles)
I know.

Andy and Pepper laugh and giggle. Andy smiles and
comes closer to her. Soon, they are kissing again.
Pepper moves on top of Andy and starts to giggle. She
starts to kiss him all over. Morgan looks over at
them and rolls his eyes. He continues to listen to
Pepper giggle, and then reaches over to the radio and
turns it on, hitting the song Whatever Gets You
Through the Night by John Lennon. He sits back and
starts to read his book.

		KEMPER
Maybe Andy and Pepper could sit up here and drive and
we could have a chance back there.

Erin smiles and holds his hand.

		ERIN
You wouldn't stop.

		KEMPER
That's just how I work.

		ERIN
You're telling me you have batteries inside you or
something?

		KEMPER
Something like that.

		ERIN
Maybe on the next pit stop.

Kemper brings her hand up to his mouth and kisses it.

		MORGAN
Which will be when exactly?

		KEMPER
As soon as we find a town. Just calm down, okay?
You've been complaining ever since this trip began.

		MORGAN
Maybe that's because we have no ice or water. Just a
couple of horny teenagers.

Andy sits up and takes a deep breath.

		ANDY
Whoa...Maybe we do need a pit stop. I need water just
as the next guy in here.

		PEPPER
(fanning herself)
Tell me about it. This guy can go on for hours.

Andy winks and holds her hand. She smiles and he
growls. Everyone laughs, even Morgan. He rolls his
eyes. Andy and Pepper continue to kiss.

		MORGAN
Can we hurry it up, please? I need to make it to
Mexico before eight.

		KEMPER
Morgan, will you calm down? Everything is going to be
fine. There has to be a town around here somewhere.
We can stop; get some drinks, ice, and gas.

		ERIN
Morgan, we'll make it in time okay. In the meantime,
why don't you smoke some of that yourself?

		MORGAN
You know, that's not such a bad idea. Anyone want
some?

Andy, while still kissing Pepper, waves his hand in a
"no thank you". Erin shakes her head. Morgan looks at
Kemper who shrugs. Morgan rolls his eyes and makes
his way to the back of the mattress. He ignores Andy
and Pepper and grabs one of the full bags.

		ERIN
We need gas?

		KEMPER
It's almost empty.

		ERIN
Perfect.

		MORGAN
(O.S.)
Anyone have a match?

Kemper rolls his eyes and pulls out a packet of
matches from his pocket and hands them to Morgan.

		MORGAN
(O.S.)
Thanks.

		KEMPER
(sarcastically)
No problem.

Erin rolls her eyes and leans her head against the
window.

EXT. VAN_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_DAY

We watch as the van rolls down the long country road
and pass a sign that reads:

TRAVIS COUNTY, TEXAS!
DRIVE SLOW, SEE OUR CITY
DRIVE FAST, SEE OUR SHERIFF!

As the van disappears up the hill, dust comes flying
everywhere, even into the CAMERA. We watch as the van
becomes a small speck.

INT. VAN_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_(CONT.)

Erin leans her head on Kemper's shoulder. He smiles
and continues driving. We look inside the back of the
van to see that Morgan is smoking a now rolled up
paper full of weed. He smiles as smoke fills the air.
Andy separates from Pepper and fans his hand in the
air.

		ANDY
Jesus, Morgan, can't you at least roll down a window
or something?

		MORGAN
You do it. I'm too busy.

Andy gives Morgan the finger, who makes a face.
Pepper sits up and opens the window to the side of
her. She lies back down and gives Morgan  look. Andy
sits next to her and smiles.

		ANDY
Thanks.

		PEPPER
Anything for my baby.

They smile and kiss. Morgan rolls his eyes and takes
a huge whiff of the weed. Erin still has her head
against Kemper's shoulder.

		KEMPER
I love you.

Erin says nothing, but snuggles closer to him and
lets out a love-filled sigh.

		MORGAN
You two make me sick, you know that?

Erin sits up from Kemper's shoulder and grabs
Morgan's rolled up paper of weed and throws it out
the window.

		MORGAN
BITCH!

		ERIN
The feeling is mutual, shithead.

		MORGAN
Now, must we resort to name-calling?

		ERIN
Of course not...we can skip right to the part where I
beat the crap out of you, if you wish.

		KEMPER
Talk about sibling rivalry.

		MORGAN
(ignoring Kemper)
The day you kick the crap out of me will be the day
that Pepper takes a vow of celibacy.

		PEPPER
(from behind the backseat)
The thought makes my skin crawl. Although, he does
have a point. Sorry, Erin.

		ERIN
(to Morgan)
I could wipe the windshield with you right now, you
weak-ass little weasel!

		MORGAN
Oh yeah...I'm the weasel!  (laughing) Look who you
choose for a boyfriend!

Erin gives Morgan a look of pure venom and, without
warning, pulls back and punches him in the face,
causing his lip to bleed.

		ANDY
(stops kissing Pepper)
I see that weed has finally knocked some sense into
you, huh, Morgan?

Morgan gives Andy the finger and sits up. Morgan just
has a look of pure shock on his face as he reaches
his hand to the cut on his lip.  Erin seems surprised
at her actions, also, but she is breathing hard and
is obviously still angry.  Pepper and Andy have
separated themselves from each other and are now
looking open-mouthed from Erin to Morgan and back
again.

		KEMPER
Alright, that's it!

Kemper slams on the brakes and the van halts in the
middle of the road.  Everyone in the van is slammed.

		PEPPER
What the hell is wrong with you!?

		KEMPER
(to Morgan)
Look...if you insist on being an asshole, I suggest
you pick up your over-inflated ego and lug it back to
the crack pipe you crawled out of!  It's 200 degrees
outside, it's God-knows-how-many miles to the nearest
town and I am not going to sit here and listen to you
two!

Kemper takes a deep breath and continues, while Erin
lowers her eyes and Morgan's smirk returns to his
face.

		KEMPER
(in a calmer tone)
Now, I want you both to just...ignore eachother until
we get to a town.  (turns to Andy and Pepper) And you
two can...get back to business.

Andy and Pepper look at eachother, smile and begin to
kiss passionately, soon disappearing again behind the
back seat.  Erin turns back around to look through
the windshield and Morgan tries to nurse his lip as
well as he can with a greasy napkin. Erin turns
around to look at Morgan.

		ERIN
I'm sorry, Morgan.

		MORGAN
I'm sure you are.

		ERIN
I am, I don't know what I was thinking.

		MORGAN
You never do.

		ERIN
What the hell is that suppose to mean?

		MORGAN
There's nothing in that small head of yours.

		ERIN
Do you want me to hit you again?

		MORGAN
Stay the fuck away from me.

Erin looks ahead out into the road and leans her head
against the window. Morgan shakes his head and pulls
the napkin away from his mouth. Blood is all over the
napkin. He sighs.

		KEMPER
You know, I think I might need some of that weed
right about now.

Silence.

Andy pulls away from Pepper and looks into her eyes.

		ANDY
Would you really take a vow of celibacy?

		PEPPER
Andy, do I look like I'm the kind of person who would
do that? I mean...especially when you love...

Pepper reaches her hand over to Andy's ass and
squeezes it.

		PEPPER
(cont.)
...This?

Andy laughs and growls as Pepper pulls herself back
towards Andy, kissing him again. She moves on top of
him and messes with his hair. They both smile and
laugh.

		MORGAN
I am officially nauseated.

Erin rolls her eyes and looks ahead to see an open
road, full of dirt and rocks.

		KEMPER
(sighs; sarcastically)
Have you ever seen anything so beautiful?

		ERIN
(huffs)
If I could only see this every single day of my life.

		MORGAN
I'd rather blow my brains out.

		ERIN
That might come sooner than you think.

		MORGAN
Just hurry up and drive the car. I need to get to
Mexico soon.

		ERIN
Why are you in such a hurry?

		MORGAN
Do you know how much all this is worth? I'll be
living in style!

		ERIN
Not when I tell mom and dad the real reason why you
went on this trip.

		MORGAN
You were in on it, too.

		ERIN
I was not!

		MORGAN
You cam along, and that's all that matters!

		KEMPER
You want another fat lip? Sit back and relax.

Morgan sighs and leans back. As Erin looks ahead out
the windshield, she sees a young girl of about their
age walking down the side of the road, wearing a very
dirty flower dress. She hugs herself and cries.

		ERIN
Hey...hey, look...

		KEMPER
Oh my god...Should we pick her up?

		MORGAN
Hell no. We're already late. Just keep driving.

		ERIN
Morgan, do you always just think about yourself?

		MORGAN
No, I just want to get there on time so I can collect
my money.

		ERIN
Money's not an option right now, Morgan.

		KEMPER
We wouldn't make it anyway. The gas is low.

		ERIN
Pull over and pick her up.

Erin rolls down her window and pokes her head out.
The rest of them look out their windows.

EXT. VAN_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_(CONT.)

The girl continues to walk down the road, not even
looking up.

		ERIN
Hey, are you okay?

The girl shakes her head without looking up. Erin
looks at Kemper, who nods.

		ERIN
Can we give you a ride?

		GIRL
I don't know where I'm going...

		ERIN
Do you live anywhere near here?

		GIRL
No...

		ERIN
Well, we could at least give you a ride. You look
exhausted. Come on in, we'll take you wherever you
want to go.

Pepper slides open the side of the van. The girl
looks up and stays silent for a second, then, she
climbs into the van. The door slides shut and the van
continues to make its way down the road.

INT VAN_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_(CONT.)

Kemper continues to drive while Erin looks back at
the girl, who sits on the mattress, crying and
rocking back and forth.

		PEPPER
What's your name?

		GIRL
Jane...

		PEPPER
Hi, Jane. I'm Pepper. And this is Andy, Morgan,
Kemper, and Erin.

Erin smiles and waves. Everyone says hi to her except
for Morgan. He rolls his eyes and looks down at his
book.

		PEPPER
We can take you wherever you want to go.

		JANE
I don't know where I want to go...I just want to get
out of here...

		PEPPER
If you don't mind me asking, what happened to you?
Why were you out here alone?

		JANE
I...I wasn't alone...

		PEPPER
Well then...Who were you with?

		JANE
My friends...

		PEPPER
Where are your friends?

Jane looks down and starts to cry again. Andy reaches
over and hands her a soft napkin. She wipes her
tears.

		JANE
They're all dead...

Erin looks at Kemper, who looks back at Jane. He
turns his head to Erin, and they both look into
eachother's eyes for a moment.

		ERIN
Who...um...who killed them?

		JANE
I...I don't know...

		KEMPER
What are we suppose to do now?

		ERIN
Just keep driving. If she was out here then there has
to be a gas station or house or something out
here...It can't be that deserted.

		KEMPER
I wouldn't be so sure about that. I mean, look
around...

Kemper looks ahead and sees a sharp turn ahead. He
decides to take it and suddenly turns into it. Ahead
of him are still nothing but dirt, grass, and old
trees.

		MORGAN
I'm not gonna make it...This is fucking perfect. I
came on this stupid trip for nothing. I sure as hell
didn't come on this trip to see four teens get off.
Especially one with such an airless head.

		ERIN
You're the one who's stoned all the time! You want me
to punch you again, don't you?!

		MORGAN
Don't fucking touch me!

		KEMPER
Then shut up, Morgan! I've had it with you two.

		ERIN
(to Kemper)
I'm sorry.

Erin leans in and hugs Kemper. In the back, we see
Andy come and sit next to Morgan.

		ANDY
You could at least pretend to be a little nice on
this trip.

		MORGAN
You'd have to kill me.

		ANDY
That'll be easy.

Morgan gives Andy a look of venom.

		ANDY
I bet you have never even experienced physical
pleasure, have you, Morgan?

		MORGAN
What's your point?

		ANDY
I'm just saying I wouldn't be talking if I were you.
(makes his way back towards Pepper) Virgin.

Morgan smirks. Pepper rubs Jane's back as she begins
to cry again. Jane covers her ears and rocks back and
forth.

		JANE
He's a bad man...

		PEPPER
Who?

		ANDY
What are you talking about, Jane? You need to talk to
us.

Jane doesn't speak. She moves to the back of the van,
up against the back window. Pepper moves up to the
front of the van.

		PEPPER
I don't know what we should do.

		ERIN
We need to find someone.

		KEMPER
That's not gonna happen. This van is going to stop
any second.

		MORGAN
It better not! I knew we should have taken my van! I
fucking new it! What the hell are we suppose to do
with the girl?

		KEMPER
We'll take he as far as she needs to go.

		MORGAN
Which will be right here. Stop the van and let her
out.

		ERIN
Morgan!

		MORGAN
What!?

Erin smirks at Morgan, who rolls his eyes.

		MORGAN
And then?

		KEMPER
And then find someway to get home.

		MORGAN
You mean...we're not going to Mexico?

		KEMPER
No, we're not.

		MORGAN
Jesus, Kemper! I came all the way on this trip for
this shit? This is bull.

		ERIN
Morgan, I really think that Jane is a little more
important than some stupid weed.

		MORGAN
(whisper)
Stupid weed my ass.

Erin turns back towards Kemper, who looks at the gas
gauge once again.

		ERIN
So...?

		KEMPER
Shit...

		ERIN
What?

EXT. VAN_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_(CONT.)

Slowly, we watch the van as it pulls over to the
dirt. Slowly, the engine stops, and it is silence. We
pan up from a  sky view of the van as it lies
perfectly still.

INT. VAN_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_(CONT.)

We watch as everyone looks around. Kemper puts his
head on the wheel, smacking his head against it.

		ANDY
What happened?

		KEMPER
The van's down.

		ANDY
What does that mean?

		KEMPER
We need gas, that's what it means.

		MORGAN
Damnitt!

		PEPPER
How long do you think until we can find someone?

		KEMPER
I don't know. It's best of we all get out and look
for help.

		ERIN
I'll come with you.

Kemper and Erin step out of the van, leaving us with
Andy, Morgan, Pepper, and Jane.

Silence...

		MORGAN
I'm not staying in here with you three. Excuse me.

Morgan slides open the side of the door and pops out.
He slams it shut. Pepper looks at Jane and Andy.

		PEPPER
Look, I think we should go look for help, too. That
way we can double our chances of actually finding
someone.

		ANDY
I think so, too. Jane? You wanna come with us?

Jane shakes her head and moves towards the corner of
the van. Pepper slides open the door and steps out,
followed by Andy. He looks back at Jane, who still
hides in the corner. He shrugs and slams the door
shut.

Jane watches as they all start to walk away. She
presses her hand against the glass and starts to cry
again.

		JANE
You're all gonna die...

The CAMERA zooms in on her slowly and we suddenly

CUT TO:

EXT. VAN_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_(CONT.)

The group stands alone, wondering what to do.

		KEMPER
I think we should go in groups. I'll go with Erin and
Andy can go with Pepper. Morgan-

		MORGAN
I work better alone.

		ERIN
That's for sure.

Morgan smirks at Erin, who puts her hands in her back
pocket.

		KEMPER
Okay. We'll all meet back here in about an hour or
so.

They all nod and walk off in different directions. We
watch as they all disappear into the vast, empty
field. The CAMERA pans up to the hot blazing sun as
we slowly

FADE TO:

INT. DARK ROOM_DAY

We pan around the room to see old cans, water
dripping from the ceiling, old collections of
records, old dolls, some with no eyes, and just many
different kinds of old antiques that look like they
were never taken care of. As we pan around, we pull
into a long stairway, which lead into more darkness.
We hear distant screams in the background. Suddenly,
a young, wet girl of twenty runs out from behind the
stairs! She runs up them and heads towards an open,
dirty sliding door. She steps out of it and slides
it, leading herself into a

INT. HALLWAY_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

The girl stands still, and suddenly slams the sliding
door shut. From the outside, there are no handles or
anything else that can be seen to open it, just a
small circular peephole in the middle of the door.
The girl looks around and pants, wondering what to
do.

She stands still as she hears loud footsteps making
their way up the stairs. The girl runs towards a
closed door and tries to open it, but can't. She
looks around and sees a flight of stairs leading to
the second floor. She looks back at the sliding door,
and then runs up the stairs, disappearing into a
sharp corner. Large footsteps can be heard making
their way towards the long flight of stairs.

INT. DARK ROOM_UPSTAIRS_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

The girl walks around the room, trying to find a
place to hide. She looks around and finds nothing.
More footsteps can be heard. She pears outside a
slight crack to see two large boots walk past the
door and search somewhere else. The girl sighs and
looks behind her, only to see a window covered in
wood planks. She cries and leans up against the door.
A few seconds pass. She stands up and looks through
the crack. Nothing is there. She slowly opens the
door and steps into the

INT. HALLWAY_UPSTAIRS_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

The girl looks around, but sees nothing. We follow
her to the stairs, were she slowly starts to walk
down them step by step. A small crack can be heard,
and she looks up, but no one is there. She sighs and
closes her eyes. She continues to walk down the
stairs until she reaches the front door. She tries to
open it, but can't.

		GIRL
Shit...

She tries to unlock the door, but it is budged tight.
She looks behind her, seeing if she can find anything
to break open the lock. She hesitates, but can't find
anything. She looks to the sliding door, which stays
silent. She walks down the hallway, turning a corner
into the

INT. KITCHEN_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

The kitchen is old, but the girl doesn't seem to
notice. She opens a small drawer and pulls out a long
knife. She looks at it and then turns around after
hearing a small noise. She walks quietly towards the
open door, raising the knife high. As she makes her
way towards the door, she looks around, but sees
nothing but the same old thing.

INT. HALLWAY_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

The girl slowly walks down the hallway, looking back
every second. Her eyes are focused on the front door.

She sighs and walks towards the closed door.
Suddenly, she turns around after hearing a loud
noise. A large figure wearing a strange, leather-like
mask pops out from behind the sliding door! The girl
screams and runs towards the closed door. She swings
the knife at the lock, but nothing happens, and the
knife suddenly drops. The man, LEATHERFACE, runs
after her, screaming himself. He grabs her by the
waist and holds her up. She screams and kicks wildly
as he pulls her through the sliding door. As she
screams, the door suddenly slams shut and there is
pure silence.

INT. DARK ROOM_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

We pull down the stairs and move across the old
collectables and the dripping water. We pan around
the room to see an old furnace, a table full of
weapons of destruction, and water dripping
everywhere. We pan into another room where we see
Leatherface still holding the girl, making his way to
a large hook which lies in the middle of the air hung
onto by a wire from the ceiling. The girl continues
to scream as Leatherface sticks her on the hook from
her back! She screams wildly as we

CUT TO:

EXT. OLD HOUSE_FIELD_DAY

We continue to hear the screams in the background as
we see a very old large two-story house surrounded by
old trees and no neighbors. The screams suddenly fade
as we see a young hippie of the same age of the girl
start walking towards the house.

		HIPPIE
Marilyn? You there?

The hippie finally makes his way to the

EXT. PORCH_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

The hippie sighs and knocks on the door, which still
remains closed.

		HIPPIE
Hello? Is anyone home?

Silence. Just as the hippie starts to walk away from
the house, we hear a loud bang in the backyard. The
hippie stops and slowly makes his way into the

EXT. BACKYARD_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

As the hippie makes his way further into the
backyard, where he sees a large laundry wire hanging
in mid air, covered by dry sheets. He walks around,
losing himself in the sheets.

		HIPPIE
Marilyn? Where are you? Stop goofing on me!

Suddenly, the buzz of a chainsaw can be heard and the
boy turns around to see Leatherface, standing in
front of him, holding a chainsaw in the air! The
hippie screams as we

CUT TO BLACK.

EXT. FIELD_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_DAY

We watch as Erin and Kemper walk through the fields,
holding hands and looking around.

		ERIN
I don't know why we're even looking out here, I mean
clearly there is no one here...

		KEMPER
We have to keep looking. For Jane's sake.

		ERIN
What the hell was she talking about in there? Who
killed her friends?

		KEMPER
I don't know...But she was obviously traumatized by
the whole thing. I think we should just find a phone
and call the police.

		ERIN
If we find anyone.

Erin sighs as she suddenly pears through the fields
to see a large two-story house...the same old house
from before.

		ERIN
Hey...

		KEMPER
What?

Erin pushes through the fields, letting go of
Kemper's hand and making her way towards the house.
Feet away from the house, she stops, letting Kemper
catch up to her.

		ERIN
This is unbelievable.

		KEMPER
Who would build a house all the way out here?

		ERIN
Let's just go and call the police.

Erin and Kemper walk slowly towards the house and
quickly reach the

EXT. PORCH_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

This time, the door is open, but the screen door is
closed. Kemper knocks to the side of the door and
waits. There is no response. Erin pears inside but
sees nothing. Kemper knocks again, but there is still
no response.

		KEMPER
(into screen)
Excuse me?

		ERIN
(into screen)
Is anyone home?

		KEMPER
(into screen)
Hello?

Erin pears into the house again but continues to see
nothing. Old music can be heard in the background. A
record player can be seen in a distant room.

		ERIN
Somebody has to be home.

		KEMPER
It's out in the middle of nowhere.

They sigh.

		ERIN
Just go and get the others and I'll stay here.

		KEMPER
You sure?

		ERIN
Yeah, I'm sure.

		KEMPER
You don't have to do this. I'll wait with you.

		ERIN
Kemper, just go get the others. I'll be fine.

Kemper reaches over and kisses Erin's cheek. She
moves her head so that he kisses her lips. She smiles
as he walks away. Soon, he disappears through the
field. She sighs and looks back inside the house.

		ERIN
Hello?

Silence.

		ERIN
We need help...Is anyone here?

More silence. Erin reaches over and opens the screen
door, walking inside the

INT. HALLWAY_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

The screen door suddenly slams shut. She jumps and
turns around. She rolls her eyes and laughs. She
turns back around and walks slowly down the hallway,
seeing all sorts of collectables and records lying
all over the place.

		ERIN
Hello?

Silence.

She walks down the hallway and into the

INT. DINING ROOM_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

There is a long wooden table sitting in the middle of
the table, complete with old candles and seats fit
for six. She walks through the dining room and sees
another swinging door behind the table. She slowly
walks over to it and opens it, revealing the

INT. KITCHEN – OLD HOUSE – (CONT.)

It is the same as we had last seen it. Dirty dishes
can be seen all over. Feathers can be seen all over
the ground. Erin cringes and walks around, looking
above her to see different sorts of bones hanging
from the air by string. She opens her mouth and
covers it with her hand. She coughs and makes her way
through another open door, leading her back into the

INT. HALLWAY – OLD HOUSE – (CONT.)

There is nothing in front of her but the same old
hallway leading towards the open door. As she turns
around, she sees the closed sliding door complete
with the peephole. She knocks on it, revealing an
echo. She puts her ear up against it and knocks
again.

		ERIN
Hello?

Nothing. She sighs turns around, walking back down
the hallway. Beside the stairs is another open
doorway, which leads to another empty room. She
ignores it and looks up the stairs. She sighs and
starts to walk up it very slowly.

EXT. FIELD_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_(CONT.)

Andy and Pepper can be seen walking around, looking
for someone. They stop.

		ANDY
This is hopeless.

		PEPPER
We have to keep looking. Please, Andy?

Andy stops and looks into her eyes.

		ANDY
Okay...

The smile and kiss. Slowly, they fall onto the field
and laugh.

EXT. FIELD_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_(CONT.)

We watch Morgan walk around the field, sighing and
rolling his eyes. A small noise can be heard from
behind him. He stops in his tracks and turns around.

Silence.

		MORGAN
Hello?

Nothing. The field sways back and forth from the
wind.

		MORGAN
Kemper? Get your cheep ass out here.

Silence. Morgan looks around and then continues
walking. Suddenly, he bumps right into

KEMPER!

Morgan jumps and steps back. They both breathe
deeply.

		MORGAN
Kemper, you ass.

		KEMPER
Don't give me that right now, Morgan. Erin found a
house. Let's go find Andy and Pepper.

Morgan rolls his eyes as they both walk off into the
field.

EXT. FIELD_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_(CONT.)

Andy and Pepper lie down on the ground, kissing
passionately. Suddenly, they are covered with shadows
as they both look up to see Kemper and Morgan staring
at them.

		MORGAN
Is that the only thing you guys do?

Andy smirks as he helps himself and Pepper up.

		KEMPER
Erin and I found a house back in the field. Erin's
there looking for a phone. I told her I'd come back
and get you guys and Jane.

		MORGAN
Who cares about Jane?

		PEPPER
I'll go get Jane. Just point of the direction of the
house.

		KEMPER
(points)
It's that way. But you better hurry.

		PEPPER
(walking away)
Will do!

Kemper walks away with Andy and Morgan as we watch
Pepper walk back towards the van.

INT. UPSTAIRS_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Erin walks around, looking for any person she can
find. She hears a slight noise from downstairs and
quickly runs down the stairs, making her way towards
the

INT. HALLWAY_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Erin looks around, but sees nothing but the same old
thing.

		ERIN
Hello? Is anyone here?

Silence. She sighs.

EXT. VAN_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_(CONT.)

Pepper finally makes her way to the van and slowly
opens it.

		PEPPER
Great news, Jane, Erin found a-

No one is in the van. Pepper looks around, but sees
nothing. She looks around the field, but doesn't see
Jane anywhere.

		PEPPER
Shit...

She slides the door shut and makes her way back
towards the field.

INT. HALLWAY_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Erin slowly walks towards the closed sliding door and
knocks on it again. There is still nothing. She
slowly moves her eye towards the peephole and pears
inside. There is nothing there. She pulls herself
back and leans her back up against the door. She
sighs and closes her eyes.

Slowly, we watch as the peephole slowly starts to
squeak. Erin moves her head back towards the
peephole. It is the same as it was. She slowly
continues to pear through the peephole, but there is
still nothing. We watch her through the other side of
the door, her eye up against the screen in a circular
motion. Suddenly, a hand taps her shoulder and she
screams! She turns back around to see Kemper, staring
at her and smiling.

		ERIN
Jesus, Kemper, you scared the shit out of me.

		KEMPER
I'm sorry...

		ERIN
Don't worry about it. Find everyone?

		KEMPER
Pepper's making her way back with Jane. Did you find
anyone?

		ERIN
Not even a phone.

		KEMPER
Let's wait outside.

Kemper and Erin walk outside into the porch as the
CAMERA slowly moves into the peephole.

EXT. PORCH_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Kemper and Erin walk down the porch stairs to join
Andy and Morgan, who sit on the last step of the
porch.

		ANDY
Find anything?

		ERIN
It doesn't seem like anyone's home.

		MORGAN
Figures.

They all look up and see Pepper walking towards them,
alone. Andy stands up while Kemper and Erin walk
towards her. Morgan continues to sit down.

		KEMPER
Where's Jane?

		PEPPER
She wasn't in the van.

		ANDY
What?

		PEPPER
When I went back, no one was in the van. She was
gone.

		ERIN
Great...

		ANDY
Where do you think she is?

		MORGAN
(O.S.)
Mexico.

They all ignore him and turn back to Pepper.

		PEPPER
What are we suppose to do now?

		KEMPER
We need to find someone first. And if we do, then we
have to call the cops I guess. It's not safe for Jane
to be out here alone. Let's all just wait here.

		PEPPER
Where exactly?

		KEMPER
Maybe they're in the back. Let's go.

They all walk towards the backyard of the house, even
Morgan. We pan back to reveal the large house as they
all disappear into the backyard.

EXT. BACKYARD_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

They all pass the blowing sheets and walk all the way
towards the back of the yard. It is a mess. There is
a row of old cars sitting in the backyard, all warn
out and from the forties.

		ERIN
Oh my god...

		KEMPER
They sure are collectors aren't they?

Erin walks towards the cars, followed by Morgan and
Kemper. Pepper walks over to an old Volkswagen and
pears inside of it. It is very dirty and smelly, from
the look of Pepper's face.

		PEPPER
(covers her nose)
Oh my god...

		KEMPER
Do you think any of them start?

		MORGAN
I highly doubt that.

Erin looks around and passes a large row of tires,
making her way towards a very large black truck. She
looks inside of it and then looks around some more,
passing more cars. Pepper walks away from the cars
and makes her way towards a large opening in the back
of the house, a greenhouse if you will.

There is no door, and it is very dusty and black.
Pepper doesn't look inside of it, she just sits down
on the nearest log. She covers her forehead and
sighs.

		PEPPER
I guess we just have to wait here.

		ERIN
I'm going back in there as soon as I can. I know
there's a phone in there. I can feel it.

		MORGAN
Than get in there and call the cops so we can get our
car fixed.

		ERIN
Do you only think of yourself, Morgan?

		MORGAN
The only two things I care about in this world are my
drugs and I.

Erin gives him the finger and continues to walk
around.

		ANDY
Smooth, Morgan. Smooth.

Morgan huffs and rolls his eyes. He sits near Pepper
on a small wooden chair. Andy walks over to Pepper.
She stands up and holds him. She puts her head
against his chest.

		PEPPER
So what do we do now?

		ANDY
Like you said...Wait I guess.

		PEPPER
That really stinks.

		ANDY
Why's that?

Pepper looks into his eyes and smiles.

		PEPPER
Because I'm in the mood.

Andy smiles as the both come together and kiss. They
both olds eachother's hands.

		ANDY
Why don't we go...

Andy points his head to the old house. Pepper smiles.

		PEPPER
Are you sure no one's home?

		ANDY
Erin said she didn't see anyone.

Pepper bites her lip and smiles. She tugs at Andy's
arm.

		ANDY
Um...we're going to go look around more. We'll be
back later.

Pepper giggles as they disappear around the corner.

		MORGAN
You know that they're not really going to look
around, right?

Erin looks at Kemper and sighs.

INT. HALLWAY_OLD HOUSE_SECONDS LATER

Andy and Pepper open the screen door and step inside.

		ANDY
Wow...

		PEPPER
It's really old...

		ANDY
Let's go upstairs.

Andy starts to walk upstairs, Pepper in hand. They
both look around and continue to make their way up
the stairs. They finally make it up the stairs and
turn a sharp corner, making their way into a dark
room.

EXT. BACKYARD_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Erin sits on the old log like Pepper was and covers
her forehead. Kemper stands next to her while Morgan
continues to sit on the small wooden chair.

		KEMPER
How long are they going to be in there?

		ERIN
Knowing them, forever.

		MORGAN
No shit.

INT. DARK ROOM_UPSTAIRS_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Andy and Pepper lie on a dirty bed. They both smile
and start to kiss.

		PEPPER
So what do you want to do first?

		ANDY
You mean I get to decide?

		PEPPER
Yep.

Andy smiles and pulls Pepper towards him. They kiss
passionately.

EXT. BACKYARD_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Erin stands up and is about to walk away when a black
FIGURE runs across the dark greenhouse. She jumps and
Morgan stands up.

		KEMPER
What?

		MORGAN
What's the he'll is wrong with you?

		ERIN
I...I...(pointing) I just saw something...

		KEMPER
That's impossible. No one's here...Are they?

Erin slowly steps inside the room, seeing a bunch of
old furniture and other sorts of dirty and old
material. Morgan looks around as well. He makes his
way to a large cupboard and looks down to see a small
jar rolling its way towards him. He stops it with his
foot and picks it up. Inside is a single picture of
Jane. Also inside the jar seems to be green water,
the color of pickle juice.

		MORGAN
Hey, guys...Come look at this...

Erin and Kemper walk over to Morgan and stare at the
jar. Erin picks it up and examines it.

		ERIN
Oh my god...It's Jane...

		KEMPER
What was she doing here?

		MORGAN
Do you think this has anything to do with that thing
she was talking about in the van?

		KEMPER
What thing?

		MORGAN
About her friends being dead...A bad man killing them
or something like that?

		KEMPER
I don't know...

		ERIN
Just put it back, Morgan.

Morgan takes it and slowly makes his way to the
cupboard. He slowly opens it and sees millions of the
same kind of jars, all with different pictures inside
of them.

		MORGAN
Jesus...

Erin turns around and her mouth drops open. She and
Kemper walk towards it slowly. They all pick up a
different jar and examine them.

		ERIN
Oh my god...

		KEMPER
What the hell is wrong with these people?

		ERIN
Their completely twisted, you know that?

		ERIN
What were they all doing here?

They examine the jars once again and then put them
back, shutting the cupboard quickly.

INT. DARK ROOM_UPSTAIRS_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

We watch as Andy and Pepper continue to talk and
laugh. Suddenly, a loud bang can be heard from
downstairs. They both jump and stay silent.

		PEPPER
What was that?

		ANDY
It's probably Erin or somebody. Come on, let's go.

They both get up and hold eachother's hands as they
walk out of the room and head towards the stairs.

INT. HALLWAY_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

From the bottom of the stairs, we watch Andy and
Pepper slowly make their way down the stairs. Andy
walks outside to the porch, followed by Pepper.

EXT. PORCH_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

They look around, but see nothing. They hold
eachother's hands and make their way to the back of
the house.

EXT. BACKYARD_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Erin, Kemper, and Morgan continue to look around just
as Andy and Pepper arrive.

		ERIN
You guys have to check this out.

Andy and Pepper move to the cupboard where the group
stands. Erin hands Andy the jar with Jane's picture
in it.

		ANDY
What the hell is that?

		ERIN
We don't know...I think these people have something
to do with the thing Jane was talking about in the
van.

		PEPPER
You mean...about her friends dying and all that shit?

		ERIN
That's what we think.

		KEMPER
And someone's here, too. Erin just saw them.

		MORGAN
Where did they go?

		ERIN
I'm not sure...I think they went back inside the
house.

		KEMPER
I'm going back inside.

		ERIN
Not without me you're not.

Kemper and Erin make their way back towards the
house. Morgan shrugs and walks with them. Andy and
Pepper soon join them. From behind, we see the black
FIGURE runs across the room once again.

INT. HALLWAY_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Everyone arrives in the house and looks around.

		ERIN
I need to find a phone.

Erin walks into the dining room followed by Kemper.
She looks around and sees a large box full of
collectables while Kemper looks around and makes his
way into the kitchen. We cut back to Andy, Morgan,
and Pepper. They walk down the hallway and come face-
to-face with the closed sliding door. Pepper knocks
on it and looks into the peephole.

		PEPPER
IS anyone here?

Andy stands with Pepper, who continues to knock on
the door. Morgan look to the right of the sliding
door and sees a closed white door. He opens it and
looks down a long flight of stairs.

		MORGAN
Hey...

Andy and Pepper look at the open door. They all look
at eachother and start to walk down the stairs.

INT. STAIRS_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

They all walk down the dark stairs and breathe
deeply. Suddenly, the door suddenly slams shut. They
all turn around and jump.

		MORGAN
Jesus...

		PEPPER
Keep going.

They all shrug and continue to walk down the stairs.

INT. KITCHEN_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Kemper looks around and sees all the feathers and
bones hanging in the air.

INT. BASEMENT_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Andy, Pepper and Morgan finish walking down the
stairs and make their way further down into the
pitch-black basement. They all look around to see
pipes clinging to all the sides of the walls. Steam
erupts from them slowly. Noise forms all around them.
They all look around for a light switch. Morgan looks
around under one of the pipes and a light switch.

		ANDY
Could someone turn on a light?

		MORGAN
I'm working on it!

Morgan finally switches on a light. A loud steam can
be heard from above them. They all look up and watch
as lights flicker on and off at the end of the wet
hallway. Water drips from the pipes. They all start
to walk forward. A single door lies at the end of the
hallway.

		ANDY
Do you think there's even a phone in there?

		PEPPER
There's only one way to find out.

They all start to walk down the hallway slowly,
looking around from time to time.

INT. KITCHEN_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Kemper looks around some more and cringes. He turns
around and makes his way back into the

INT. DINING ROOM_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Erin continues to look through the old box. Kemper
joins her.

		ERIN
Look at this stuff...

Old records and vases can be seen all over the place.
Old pictures from the 1800's are with it. Erin picks
up an old broken telephone.

		ERIN
If only it worked.

Erin huffs and looks around some more. Kemper joins
her and picks up an old vase. Suddenly, a loud bang
can be heard behind them. Erin suddenly drops what
she was looking at and looks ahead of herself,
breathing deep.

		ERIN
What the hell was that?

She looks over at Kemper, who shrugs. They both walk
towards the hallway and look around.

INT. HALLWAY_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

They both look around.

		ERIN
Where is everybody?

		KEMPER
I don't know...

They look past the stairs and see another room, the

INT. LIVING ROOM_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

A single couch can be seen in the corner of the room,
along with an old small table with an antique cord
phone. Erin sees it and runs towards it. She picks it
up and tries to dial. She stops and sits still, the
phone glued to her ear.

		ERIN
Hello?

Silence. She throws down the phone and sighs. She
turns around and bumps into Kemper.

		KEMPER
So?

		ERIN
There's no dial tone.

		KEMPER
Shit...Are you sure you saw someone?

		ERIN
Someone has to be here. Why would all this shit be
here?

		KEMPER
I don't know...

Erin looks behind her to see another door. She walks
towards it and opens it. She screams as she bumps
into Andy, Pepper and Morgan. They all jump and
breathe hard.

		PEPPER
Did you find anything?

		ERIN
Old collectables and a broken phone.

		MORGAN
That's just perfect.

		KEMPER
Where were you guys?

		ANDY
Basement. We didn't find much. Just a locked door and
some old pipes.

		ERIN
Let's just go back to the yard.

		ANDY
What about a phone? We need to fix the van and Jane's
missing.

		MORGAN
Who cares about Jane!?

		PEPPER
Did you guys check upstairs?

		ERIN
Nope.

		ANDY
I'll stay in here and try to find a phone. You guys
can just wait outside, alright?

		PEPPER
But Andy, I-

		ANDY
Pepper, just go outside. It'll be fine.

They all nod and start to walk outside. Pepper stands
with Andy.

		PEPPER
You sure you don't need any help?

		ANDY
I'll be perfectly fine.

Pepper smiles and kisses him for a long time. She
lets him go and starts to walk away, his hand her
hers. She lets it go and walks out of the house. He
sighs and walks towards the hallway.

INT. HALLWAY_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Andy steps inside the hallway and looks up the
stairs.

		ANDY
Hello? Is anyone here?

There is a slight noise behind the closed slide door.
He slowly walks towards it and continues to look
around. He makes his way to the sliding door and
knocks on it.

		ANDY
Hello?

Nothing. He looks through the peephole and looks
around. He sees nothing and suddenly backs away. He
sighs and looks around, trying to find a phone. He
continues to stand in front of the door while still
trying to find someone or something.

EXT. BACKYARD_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Everyone sits back down in front of the greenhouse.
They all sigh.

		PEPPER
If he's not back in ten minutes, I'm going in there.

INT. HALLWAY_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

		ANDY
Hello? We need help is anyone there?

Silence. Andy turns and opens the door to the
basement.

INT. BASEMENT_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Andy walks down the stairs and makes his way down the
now lit basement hallway. The door at the end of the
hallway remains the same. He finally makes his way to
the door and tries to open it, but it won't budge. He
kicks on it, but nothing happens. He kicks at it one
more time and pounds on it. Suddenly, it opens, and
he falls inside.

INT. ROOM_BASEMENT_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Andy gets up from the wet and feather filled floor
and dusts himself off. He looks up to see meat
hanging from hooks all over the ceiling. He holds his
nose and watches as flies fly around everywhere. He
looks around more to see feathers all around the
floor. Bones hang from the ceiling as well. He
cringes and walks out of the room.

INT. BASEMENT_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Andy covers his nose as he runs down the hall and
back towards the door. He makes his way up the stairs
and opens the door to the

INT. HALLWAY_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

He shuts the door and closes his eyes in disgust. He
stands next to the closed sliding door and sighs. He
brushes his hand through his hair and closes his eyes
once again.

Suddenly, the sliding door opens and Leatherface
stands there wearing a bloody apron and rubber
gloves.

		ANDY
(turns around)
OH SHIT!

Leatherface screams as Andy starts to run towards the
door. Leatherface runs after him quickly! Andy tries
to open the door, but turns to see Leatherface nearly
inches away from him. He turns and starts to run up
the stairs, followed by Leatherface!

INT. UPSTAIRS_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Andy runs down a long hallway and turns into a room
we have not seen before. He enters it and shuts the
door and locks it, just as Leatherface pounds on the
door.

INT. ROOM_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Leatherface continues to pound on the door while Andy
looks around for a place to escape. There is nothing.

		ANDY
SHIT!

As the pounding continues, we see Andy run towards a
closed window. He pounds on it, but it does not move!
As he runs towards the door, Leatherface's hand comes
crashing through it, reaching for him, but he backs
away. Suddenly, the door comes crashing down and
Leatherface stands there, screaming through the thick
mask. Andy backs away into a corner and tries to
fight him off.

Leatherface tries to grab him just as Andy runs out
of the room and down the stairs.

INT. HALLWAY_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Andy makes his way to the front door, Leatherface
running after him wildly. He manages to open it, but
doesn't have enough time to get through it.
Leatherface grabs him, putting his bloody hand over
his mouth. Leatherface shuts the door with a loud
bang.

INT. HALLWAY_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Leatherface still holds onto Andy, who kicks and
screams wildly. He grabs him and throws him into the
open sliding door, sending him toppling down the wet
stairs. Leatherface walks in and slams the sliding
door right into the CAMERA.

INT. DARK ROOM_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

As Andy comes falling down to the wet ground, he
looks up to see Leatherface coming right after him!
He stands up and starts to run to the end of the
room, finally facing a corner!

		ANDY
Shit!

Leatherface grabs his bloody chainsaw from the table
and starts it up, letting us hear the buzz all around
the screen. Andy makes his way into the other room,
where all the hooks lay in the air. There is nowhere
to hide now. As he turns around, he sees Leatherface
standing right in front of him, waving his chainsaw
in the air! Andy screams as the chainsaw comes down
and slices into his stomach! Blood pours everywhere
as Andy pulls his head back, just as blood comes
pouring out of his mouth. Andy's distant screams fade
away as we

CUT TO:

EXT. BACKYARD_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Everyone still stands still, looking around and
waiting for Andy to get back.

		PEPPER
It's been long enough. I'm going in there.

		ERIN
Pepper, just wait, okay? He'll be out in a second. It
takes a long time to tell the cops exactly where this
house is located.

		KEMPER
Yeah, Kemper, I mean, I couldn't even tell anyone
directions to where this place is.

		ERIN
Which is probably why he's taking so long.

		MORGAN
The guy's a jackass, what can you do?

Morgan looks around just as Pepper approaches him. He
looks up and smiles.

		PEPPER
How's that lip?

		MORGAN
Better.

Suddenly, Pepper punches him right in the lip! Morgan
goes flying back for a second and then comes back up,
holding his bloody lip. Erin and Kemper laugh.

		MORGAN
Bitch.

Pepper air kisses him and sits down. She sighs and
looks at Morgan, who stops the blood flow with his
shirt.

		PEPPER
If he isn't here in five minutes, I'm going in there,
whether you like it or not.

Morgan rolls his eyes as Erin and Kemper hold
eachother and sigh.

EXT. OLD HOUSE_DAY

We stare at the lonely house for a moment or two,
then follow back in the

EXT. BACKYARD_OLD HOUSE_LATER

Everyone is the same as they were but Pepper cannot
stand it any longer. She stands up and walks towards
the porch.

		MORGAN
Where are the hell are you going?

		PEPPER
I'm going to go find Andy.

		ERIN
Pepper, I'm coming with you.

		KEMPER
So am I.

Pepper, Erin, and Kemper start to walk off into the
corner. Morgan stands still, and then gets up and
walks towards them.

INT. HALLWAY_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

We watch as Pepper, Erin, Kemper, and Morgan walk in
slowly through the front door. They all look around,
but see nothing than the same thing they had all seen
before.

		MORGAN
This house is fucking creepy...

		KEMPER
Did you just notice that?

		PEPPER
Andy? Andy, where are you?

Pepper walks over to the closed sliding door and
knocks on it.

		PEPPER
Andy?

Silence. Everyone else looks around as Pepper starts
to turn around, but sees the door to the basement.

		PEPPER
Guys, I'm going back in the basement to see if he's
there.

		ERIN
I'll check upstairs. The rest of you can join Pepper.
She needs all the help she can get.

They all nod as Erin walks off. Pepper opens the door
and starts to walk down the stairs, followed by
Kemper and Morgan.

INT. BASEMENT_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Pepper takes the lead, followed by Morgan and Kemper.
They all look around while the steam continues to
rise from the pipes. A bang can be heard from behind
the closed door ahead of them.

		PEPPER
Andy?

		MORGAN
Face it, he's not here. We've been down here before.

		KEMPER
Shut up, Morgan and just look for him.

		PEPPER
Andy? Where the hell are you?

INT. UPSTAIRS_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Erin walks around the hallways, searching the rooms,
but finds nothing.

		ERIN
Andy? Andy, are you here?

Nothing. A small creak can be heard downstairs, and
Erin rushes towards it. She runs down the stairs only
to find the same old

INT. HALLWAY_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Nothing. Erin looks around, but there is no one
there. She turns to the left of the stairs and walks
into the

INT. DINING ROOM_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

She looks around to see the same box. She looks ahead
to see another phone in the corner! She runs towards
it and picks it up. Her smile soon turns into a
frown. She slams down the phone and sighs.

She pulls back her hair and walks back into the
hallway.

INT. BASEMENT_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Pepper looks at the smoky, water filled pipes as
Kemper and Morgan suddenly jump back as a loud
footstep can be heard.

		KEMPER
What the hell...

		PEPPER
Andy? Is that you?

		MORGAN
It's not Andy, Pepper, get over it.

		PEPPER
Andy!?

Another footstep can be heard and Kemper steps out.

		KEMPER
All right, that's it, if somebody's out there just
come on out!

Silence. Another footstep can be heard. Kemper steps
out again.

		KEMPER
Come on out now!

There is a loud bang and the group jumps as they turn
and see Erin, standing on the stairway.

		ERIN
What the hell is going on?

		KEMPER
Let's just get out of here.

		PEPPER
What about Andy? I'm not going to leave him!

		KEMPER
We'll go back to the van and if he doesn't show up in
an hour or so, then we'll go look for him.

		PEPPER
It would be just as easy to look for him now!

		MORGAN
Just shut the fuck up and let's get out of here.

Pepper stares at Morgan for a second, and then storms
out on the rest of them. In a second, they all follow
her all the way up to the

INT. HALLWAY_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

They all step out of the basement door and quickly
shut it. Pepper stands, looking at everyone.

		PEPPER
All right, but if he doesn't show up I swear I am
coming back here.

		MAN
(O.S.)
Oh no you won't!

They all jump and turn around to see GRANDPA DRAYTON
SAWYER, an old man in his late seventies. He sits in
a wheelchair and smokes a cigar.

		DRAYTON
What the hell are you doing in my house?

Drayton slams down a large cane and stares at them.

		ERIN
I'm sorry...We were only looking for a phone.

		DRAYTON
I don't have one. Get out now.

		ERIN
Please, we need to call the police.

		DRAYTON
Unless you have a good reason for trespassing, there
is no way I am going to let you use the phone.

		KEMPER
Look, our car broke down and a friend of ours is
missing. Not to mention a hurt girl.

		DRAYTON
Go find another phone. And get out of my house.

Erin, Kemper, Morgan, and Pepper make their way
towards the door. They all walk out except for
Pepper.

		PEPPER
We just wanted to use the phone.

		DRAYTON
I don't really think that was a good enough excuse so
get the hell out of my house. Now.

		PEPPER
Is it illegal to ask someone for a simple phone call?

		DRAYTON
Get out.

As Pepper walks out of the door, she gives Drayton
the finger. He smirks as the door slams shut.

EXT. OLD HOUSE_FIELD_(CONT.)

They all step down from the porch and stand still.

		ERIN
What do we do now?

		KEMPER
We go back to the van and wait.

		MORGAN
We can't go back here! Not with that crazy bastard
hanging around here!

		PEPPER
So you're saying we just have to wait at the van
until he shows up? Hell no! I am not going to sit on
my ass waiting for him to get back, which will
probably take hours! I say we search for him now!

		KEMPER
There's nothing we can do now.

Kemper starts to walk away. Erin shrugs and walks
with him. Morgan joins them. Pepper stands still. A
small tear forms in her eye. She wipes it and looks
back at the house. She sighs and walks off with the
group.

FADE TO:

EXT. VAN_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_SUNSET

We watch the sun as it comes closer towards sunset.
We pan into the windows of the van very quietly.

INT. VAN_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_(CONT.)

Everyone is asleep, except for Pepper, who sits up,
rocking back and forth and biting her nails. She
looks to see Morgan lying down on the mattress and
Erin holding onto Kemper's waits as she sleeps.
Kemper's face is turned towards Erin's face. It's
like it's the perfect image...The perfect couple.
Pepper sighs and slides open the door. She looks at
everyone and sighs.

		PEPPER
I'm sorry.

She bites her lip and then shuts the door quietly.

FADE TO:

EXT. OLD HOUSE_LONELY FIELD_(CONT.)

We watch as Pepper comes closer and closer towards
the house. In a matter of seconds, she reaches the

EXT. PORCH_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

She looks around and then knocks on the door.
Silence. She knocks again, but still nothing. She
sighs and opens the screen door, walking right into
the

INT. HALLWAY_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Everything is the same as it was the last time we saw
it. She looks around but sees no one. She looks
upstairs but there is no sound. She sighs and stands
in the middle of the hallway.

		PEPPER
Andy?

Silence. She walks towards the closed sliding door
and stands right next to it. She puts her ear on it
to hear a few loud bangs and footsteps. She knocks on
it.

		PEPPER
Andy?

Suddenly, the noises stop, and Pepper knocks again.

		PEPPER
Andy, are you down there?

More silence. She tries to open it, but there is no
handle or anything to try and open it. She looks
around and makes her way into the

INT. KITCHEN_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

She looks around but finds nothing. She opens a
drawer and pulls out a long knife. She runs back to
the

INT. HALLWAY_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

She sticks the knife in the slit of the sliding door
and pulls to the left. Slowly, the door forms a
crack, big enough just so she can open the rest of it
with her hands. She throws down the knife and slides
open the door, revealing two flights of stairs. She
looks around and cringes. She steps inside and turns
the corner and walks down the stairs.

INT. DARK ROOM_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Pepper makes her way to the bottom of the old, wet
cellar and continues to look around.

		PEPPER
Andy?

There is pure silence. She looks ahead, only to see a
table full of weapons, an apron, and a black door way
in the back. She looks around and sees another door
to the left of her. She walks towards it slowly,
still looking around. As she walks in, she sees all
the bloody hooks hanging from the ceiling.

		PEPPER
Jesus...

She steps further into the room and looks back.

		PEPPER
Andy?

More silence. A loud bang can be heard from behind
her. Pepper runs out of the room and heads towards
the black door in the back of the room.

		PEPPER
Andy?

Suddenly, the door swings open, and Leatherface
stands there! Both Pepper and Leatherface scream
horribly! Pepper runs towards the stairs with
Leatherface running after her! He suddenly grabs her
by the waist and drags her to another room. She
screams and kicks madly as she puts his hand on her
mouth. He finally makes his way to the room with the
hooks, still holding Pepper.

Pepper turns and sees the horrifying sight and
continues to scream. Slowly, Leatherface pulls Pepper
closer and closer to the hooks. She closes her eyes
and screams as Leatherface sticks her onto the hook!
She screams and tries to pull herself off but can't!
Leatherface covers his ears and screams himself as we

FADE TO:

INT. VAN_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_(CONT.)

Erin stirs as she wakes up and slowly opens her eyes.
Morgan and Kemper are still asleep...but Pepper is
missing!  She shakes Kemper.

ERIN
(loud whisper)
Kemper!  Kemper, wake up!

		KEMPER
(groans)
Hmm...?  Erin, what's wrong?

		ERIN
Pepper's gone.

		KEMPER
What do you mean, gone?

		ERIN
What do you think I mean by gone?  She isn't here!

		KEMPER
Okay, calm down.  I'm sure she's fine.

		ERIN
Oh, God...she could get herself killed out here!

		KEMPER
I'm sure she just went looking for Andy.

A groan behind them from Morgan startles them both.

		MORGAN
(sleepily)
What's going on?

		ERIN
Pepper's missing.

		MORGAN
(coming fully awake)
What?

		KEMPER
Erin, we don't know that for sure.

		MORGAN
But, she isn't here?

		ERIN
Of course she isn't here, moron!

		MORGAN
Don't fucking call me a moron!

		KEMPER
Enough!  Shut up, the both of you...what time is it?

Morgan looks at his watch.

		MORGAN
It's almost eight.

		ERIN
I'm gonna go look for her. Anyone coming?

		KEMPER
I'll go.

		MORGAN
Me too. I'd rather go with you guys than stay in this
ratty old dump.

They all make their way to the sliding door of the
van and open it, stepping outside quietly. They slam
the door and go walking off. We watch them from the
window.

INT. OLD HOUSE_SUNSET

The group makes there up the old house's porch and
knocks on the door. There is silence.

		MORGAN
Why don't we just go in, she's probably already in
there.

		KEMPER
Just go in.

Erin sighs and opens the door.

INT. HALLWAY_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

The group walks in the house slowly. They all look
around.

		KEMPER
Pepper? You in here?

		MORGAN
Listen, I'd love to stick around and wait for Pepper
and all, but if that old man comes out again, we're
fucking dead.

		ERIN
I'm not leaving. Not until we find Pepper and Andy,
okay?

Morgan rolls his eyes and walks down the hallway.
Erin and Kemper move to the

INT. DINING ROOM_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Everything remains the same.

		KEMPER
If I see that old man again, I'm getting the hell out
of here.

		ERIN
I've never seen such a family with so many
collectables before. Not even my grandmother could
afford shit like this...

Kemper continues to look around while Erin
accidentally drops an old porcelain doll.

		ERIN
Shit...

Erin leans over to grab it when suddenly, they both
hear a loud bang. Erin quickly jumps up.

		ERIN
Morgan?

Kemper look at Erin as they both run out into the

INT. HALLWAY_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

...Where they both run smack into Morgan. They all
jump.

		ERIN
Was that you?

		MORGAN
No, I was just about to ask you the same thing...

They all look at eachother.

		ERIN
I'm gonna look upstairs.

		MORGAN
You sure love it up there, don't ya?

Erin smacks Morgan. She runs upstairs and Kemper
joins her. Morgan rolls his eyes as another loud bang
can be heard. He turns around to see the closed
sliding door. He walks towards it slowly.

		MORGAN
Pepper? Andy?

Silence.

		MORGAN
I'm in the no mood for games so stop goofing on me...

More silence. He starts to turn around when there is
another loud bang heard from behind the door. Morgan
walks towards it slowly and looks into the peephole.
Silence. He steps back and continues to look at the
door. He knocks at it.

		MORGAN
Andy? Pepper? Where the hell are you?

Morgan looks around and suddenly sees the knife lying
on the floor where Pepper had left it. He picks it up
and sticks it in the slit of the sliding door and
pulls. The door slides open. Morgan falls on the
floor and the knife comes close to hitting his leg.
He kicks it away and stands up. He looks around and
makes his way into the sliding door.

INT. DARK ROOM_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Morgan makes his way down the familiar stairs and
walks into the dark room. He looks around and covers
his nose. He looks up as a drip of water falls on his
face. He wipes it off and cringes. He continues to
look around and spots the door in the back of the
room. He walks towards it slowly and finally makes
his way in front of it. He slowly opens the door and
we watch him from inside the

INT. ROOM_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

The room is very dark, and Morgan makes his way
farther and farther into the room. He looks around
but can't see a thing. He finally grabs the handle of
a light and pulls it. A single light bulb hangs from
the middle of the ceiling, peering its light across
four dead teens! Two of them are Pepper and Andy.
They all lay on more hooks that are held up by wire.

		MORGAN
HOLY SHIT!

Morgan steps back and covers his mouth.

INT. DARK ROOM_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Morgan steps out of the room and slams the door. He
leans against it and covers his mouth. He breathes
deep. He makes his way towards the stairs but is
stopped at Leatherface appears!

Morgan screams and suddenly looks around for a way to
escape. A single rectangular window can be seen to
the right. He runs towards it and breaks it open.
Leatherface runs after him, also screaming as well.
Andy is half and half through the window. Leatherface
grabs his legs as he kicks. Leatherface is kicked
back as Morgan pulls out of the window! Leatherface
screams and runs up the stairs.

EXT. BACKYARD_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Morgan breathes deep and looks up. He is standing at
the side of the house. He runs into the backyard
where he runs into the clothesline of dry sheets. He
looks back every second to see if he's alone.

		MORGAN
ERIN! KEMPER!

Silence. The sheets are blown by the wind. He hears a
noise and continues to run. He suddenly falls to the
ground and looks up. No one is there. As he stands
up, he continues to run forward when we suddenly see
Leatherface standing in front of him! Morgan screams
as Leatherface raps the clothesline around his neck!
Morgan tries to pull it off, but can't. He breathes
deep and tries to kick away.

		MORGAN
(whisper)
Erin...

Leatherface pulls the wire closer and closer to
Morgan's neck. He can barely movie anything. Morgan
reaches out, but can't seem to do anything else.
Suddenly, Leatherface lets go, and Morgan falls to
the ground. He slowly turns around and holds on to
his neck. He coughs horribly. As he looks up, he sees
Leatherface, holding the opposite end of a hammer!
Morgan tries to scream but is still in pain.
Suddenly, the hammer comes crashing down into
Morgan's head, splattering blood all across the white
sheets, which continue to be blown by the wind.

INT. UPSTAIRS_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Erin and Kemper continue to look around the upstairs
bedrooms, only finding nothing but old furniture, old
broken dolls, and chicken feathers everywhere. Erin
walks deeper and deeper into the dark hallway and
suddenly turns a corner into another room. A slight
noise can be heard from inside of it. She knocks and
puts her ear to the door.

ERIN
Andy? Pepper?

Silence. She knocks again and there is another loud
noise.

		ERIN
Open the door you guys. I know what you're doing in
there...Come on...open the door!

Suddenly, Erin busts open the door and she goes
falling into the

INT. BEDROOM_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Erin coughs and looks up to see many different kind
of human bones being hung by a string from the
ceiling. She looks down to see that the room is
covered in feathers. She looks up to see five small
cages sitting in mid air by string, all containing
one chicken. They all make noises and try to get out
of the cages. They all peck at the cage. As Erin
looks around and continues to cringe, so looks ahead
to see a couch made completely out of human bones.
She coughs and stands up, wiping all the feathers off
of her. She runs out of the door.

		ERIN
KEMPER!

INT. HALLWAY_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Kemper pops up from behind a door and catches Erin as
she falls into his arms.

		KEMPER
What, what's wrong?

		ERIN
We have to get out of here. We need to get Morgan and
get out of here.

		KEMPER
Why? What happened?

		ERIN
These people are fucking crazy that's what now let's
go!

Erin grabs Kemper's hand and they both go running
down the stairs and into the

INT. HALLWAY_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

		ERIN
Morgan!

		KEMPER
Where are Andy and Pepper?

		ERIN
I don't know but if they're not at the van then god
knows where the hell they might be. MORGAN!

Kemper wonders around the house, searching for
Morgan. He is nowhere to be seen.

		ERIN
Morgan, where the hell are you, come on!

There is no noise but the sounds of Kemper's
footsteps.

		KEMPER
Come on.

Kemper grabs Erin's hand and they both go running at
the sliding door.

		KEMPER
(knocking)
Morgan!? Are you down there?

		ERIN
Morgan! We have to get out of here, this isn't funny!
Open the door!

Suddenly, a loud bang can be heard and Kemper and
Erin turn around immediately, seeing Drayton sitting
in his wheelchair in the middle of the hallway. The
sound was of his wooden cane banging against the
floor. He continues to smoke a cigar.

		DRAYTON
I told you to stay the hell away from my house!

		ERIN
Where is everybody?

		DRAYTON
What are you talking about?

		KEMPER
Our friends! Where the hell are our friends!?

		DRAYTON
No one has been in here besides you.

		ERIN
Bullshit! My friends were in here and I want to know
what the hell you did with them!?

		DRAYTON
If you keep talking to me like that, young lady, I'll
have you both arrested for trespassing! This is
private property!

		KEMPER
We just want to know where our friends are, then
we'll leave you alone, okay?

		DRAYTON
Get out.

		ERIN
Not until we find our friends!

Suddenly, the sliding door behind the swings open,
and they both turn around to see Leatherface! Erin
screams with fright!

		KEMPER
Jesus Christ!

Leatherface screams as Erin and Kemper run towards
the door.

EXT. PORCH_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Erin swings open the door and runs out. She turns
around to see Kemper fall to the ground!

		ERIN
KEMPER!

Kemper tries to get up, but can't. Leatherface makes
his way closer and closer towards him. Erin runs up
the stairs and grabs Kemper's hands. She pulls as
hard as she can until he finally makes free, just
escaping the clutches of Leatherface! Erin and Kemper
run into the field as Leatherface covers his ears and
screams and Drayton laughs hysterically. We fade out
the laughter as we

FADE TO:

EXT. VAN_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_(CONT.)

It is nearly dark, and no sounds can be heard
whatsoever. We watch as Erin and Kemper run towards
the van, sliding the door open and climbing inside
very quickly. They shut the door as we slowly pan up
from the quiet lonely highway.

INT. VAN_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_(CONT.)

Erin lies on the mattress, crying while Kemper sits
at the wheel, covering his eyes and wiping away the
sweat from his forehead.

		ERIN
(crying)
Jesus Christ, Kemper...

Kemper looks back at her. They both breathe hard.

		ERIN
What the hell are we suppose to do!?

		KEMPER
Do you think that they have Jane and everyone else?

		ERIN
I wouldn't think of anything else...Kemper, what the
hell are we gonna do! The van doesn't work and our
friends are fucking missing!

Erin cries and lies down on her side on the mattress.
She cries as Kemper stands up and lies down next to
her. He pulls back her hair and whispers into her
ear.

		KEMPER
Hey...I'm not going to let anything happen to you,
okay?

Erin continues to cry, but looks up into Kemper's
eyes. She nods and let's Kemper pull her into his
arms. She hugs his waist as we pan away from them,
going out the window and into the

EXT. LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_(CONT.)

We watch from the sky as the sunset slowly becomes to
turn dark. Our heroes find themselves in another
world as they lie down in the van on the lonely
stretch of country road.

FADE TO:

EXT. VAN_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_NIGHT

Crickets chirp in the background as we pan in on the
lonely, deserted van.

INT. VAN_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_(CONT.)

The van is completely silent. Erin sleeps on the
mattress with Kemper lying next to her, his arm
around her waits. They both sleep quietly. Slowly,
Kemper stirs and looks around. He looks down at Erin
and kisses her forehead. She moans and turns around.
He smiles and sits up. He wipes his eyes and looks at
his watch.

9:35

He sighs and sits up in the driver's seat. He looks
ahead of him and sees nothing but the lonely country
road. He tries to start the van, but it just
stutters. He leans back and hits the steering wheel.
He looks back and suddenly smacks his head.

		KEMPER
(whisper)
Stupid fuck.

He smiles and laughs. He crawls into the backseat and
reaches behind the mattress. He lifts up a few bags
and suitcases and finds a plastic milk bottle full of
gas. He takes it and slides open the door. He looks
at Erin, smiles, and shuts the door. We look at Erin
for a few moments, then

EXT. VAN_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_(CONT.)

We watch as Kemper makes his way to the side of the
van and opens the gas tank. He opens the milk bottle
and dips it into the gas tank. He looks around to see
nothing but open fields and the still lonely road. He
finishes up filling up the tank and throws the
plastic bottle in the middle of the road. He puts the
cap back on the tank and opens the driver's door. He
steps inside and shuts the door quietly.

INT. VAN_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_(CONT.)

He looks back and sees Erin sleeping silently. He
sighs and reaches over to start the car but can't
find the car keys.

		KEMPER
Shit...

He looks around but can't find them. He sits up and
makes his way to the back of the van. He taps Erin on
the shoulder and waits for her to wake up.

		KEMPER
Erin...Erin, wake up...

Erin's eyes suddenly open and she sees Kemper sitting
above her.

		ERIN
Hey...

		KEMPER
Hey...I just found a bottle full of gas in the back.

		ERIN
You're shitting me.

		KEMPER
No. But now I can't find the keys. Do you have them?

		ERIN
No...I thought you had them.

		KEMPER
That's why I'm asking you. Did anyone take them for
some reason?

		ERIN
I don't think so...Everyone was with us...No one
could have taken them except for-

Silence. Erin's mouth hangs open.

		KEMPER
What is it? Who took them?

		ERIN
Jane...You said Jane wasn't here when Pepper came
back, right?

Kemper looks up. His mouth drops open.

		KEMPER
Why would she take the keys?

		ERIN
I don't know. But wherever she is, I'm going to go
look for her.

		KEMPER
Erin, you can't!

		ERIN
Why not?

		KEMPER
It's pitch black outside and you might get lost!

		ERIN
Didn't you bring a flashlight?

Kemper sighs and looks around. He opens a bag and
pulls out a flashlight. He switches it on and shines
it on Erin's face.

		ERIN
Let me see it.

		KEMPER
I'm coming with you.

		ERIN
Okay, but let me hold the flashlight.

Kemper reaches over and hands the flashlight to Erin,
who slides open the door and steps out. Kemper
follows her and shuts the door on the way out.

EXT. VAN_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_(CONT.)

They both look around. Erin starts to walk the
opposite direction of the house. Kemper follows her.

		KEMPER
This is crazy, you know that? She could be anywhere
out here.

		ERIN
She could be at that house but I'm not going back
there.

		KEMPER
Why the hell would she be at that god-forsaken house?

		ERIN
I don't know. Why the hell couldn't we find
everybody, huh?

		KEMPER
Erin, this is crazy. Jane wouldn't take the keys in
the first place.

		ERIN
She could and she couldn't have, but I'm not taking
any fucking chances. I'm looking for her.

		KEMPER
If we don't find anything we're just going to have to
wait in the van until morning.

		ERIN
Whatever you say.

Kemper sighs as they both continue to walk.

		KEMPER
I'm sorry this trip has turned into such a wreck.

		ERIN
It's not your fault. It's not anyone's fault.

		KEMPER
I still want to apologize. This isn't exactly what I
planned on doing.

		ERIN
I know, Kemper. Even though you didn't cause any of
this, I accept your apology.

Kemper stops Erin from walking. They both look into
eachother's eyes. He holds her chin and brushes back
her hair.

		KEMPER
I promise none of this will happen again.

		ERIN
Kemper...

		KEMPER
Shh...

They both come close and kiss passionately. They pull
back and look at eachother.

		ERIN
I love you.

Kemper smiles and kisses her again.

		KEMPER
Come on.

Kemper continues to walk. Erin flows him, pointing
the flashlight in front of them. They suddenly enter
the dark woods.

		KEMPER
Erin, let's just go back.

		ERIN
I need to find her. We need to get those keys and get
the hell out of here.

Kemper stops walking and Erin walks into the woods.
He stands still. Erin looks back at him.

		ERIN
Come on.

Kemper sighs and walks in with her. She reaches out
her hand and soon they are walking into the woods,
hand-in-hand.

EXT. WOODS_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_(CONT.)

We watch as Erin and Kemper walk deeper and deeper
into the woods. Erin shines the light everywhere, but
nothing else can be seen but branches, bushes,
leaves, and old, dead trees. They both look around
every few seconds, but always see the same old thing.

		KEMPER
Erin, I don't think we're going to find much out
here.

		ERIN
Let's just keep checking.

		KEMPER
Why don't we just go back?

		ERIN
We can't go anywhere in the van unless we have the
keys. Now we have to find her.

		KEMPER
How do we know if she even has them?

		ERIN
Who else could have them? Didn't you leave them in
the ignition when we left?

		KEMPER
Yeah, but-

		ERIN
No one was in there after we left except Jane, and
she was gone when Pepper came back. How can you
explain that?

		KEMPER
I can't. Let's go.

Erin looks at him and then looks back ahead into the
woods. She sighs and they continue to walk.

		ERIN
Something has got to be out here.

		KEMPER
We are definitely not going back to that house.

		ERIN
No shit. They might be there, but I'm not taking any
chances. We need to find somebody else than those
creeps.

As they walk, the sound of a branch breaking can be
heard from behind them. They both turn around and
Erin shines the flashlight directly ahead of them.

		KEMPER
What the hell was that?

		ERIN
I don't know...

Silence.

		KEMPER
Andy?

		ERIN
Pepper? Morgan?

Silence.

		KEMPER
Let's go.

		ERIN
Wait...

Erin slowly walks back towards the way they come
from. She stops in her tracks.

		ERIN
Guys!?

More silence.

		KEMPER
It's not them, Erin.

		ERIN
You don't know for sure...Andy! Pepper! Morgan!

Kemper walks towards her and looks ahead of
themselves.

		KEMPER
I'll go look.

Erin stays still while Kemper walks slowly into the
woods. Erin watches him and shines the flashlight in
front of him as well. She sighs as we hear thunder
rumbling in the clouds. Erin looks up and sighs. She
shines the flashlight at Kemper, who looks around,
but sees nothing. He turns towards her and shrugs.

		KEMPER
I don't see anything.

Suddenly, the buzz of a chainsaw can be heard from
behind Kemper. He quickly turns around to see
Leatherface cutting through the branches and making
his way right towards Kemper and Erin! Erin screams
and accidentally drops the flashlight.

		ERIN
KEMPER! COME ON!

Kemper runs towards Erin and grabs her hand. They
both take off running deeper and deeper into the
woods. Leatherface makes his way through the branches
and goes chasing after them while more thunder can be
heard. As we go back to Erin and Kemper, we watch as
Erin continues to look back. She sees Leatherface
coming up right behind them!

		ERIN
Kemper...

Kemper turns around. His mouth drops open.

		KEMPER
LET'S GO!

Kemper leads as he pulls Erin's hand and they both go
running down the branches and bushes. They stop as a
large branch sits right in front of their faces with
Leatherface coming closer and closer!

		KEMPER
GO!

		ERIN
Not without you!

		KEMPER
JUST GO, ERIN! NOW!

She looks at him and suddenly pulls her way through
the branch. She looks as Kemper tries to get in
himself, but can't. He reaches out his hand as she
grabs it. She tries to pull him in but can't!

		ERIN
COME ON!

		KEMPER
I'M STUCK!

		ERIN
WHAT IS THIS, A FUCKING MOVIE!? GET OUT! NOW!

Kemper suddenly falls as Leatherface comes up closer
to him. Erin falls to the ground she looks up and
starts to cry.

		KEMPER
GO!

		ERIN
No...!

		KEMPER
Go find help!

		ERIN
Kemper, I'm not leaving you!

		KEMPER
GO!

Erin cries harder and starts to run into the woods.
She looks back to see Leatherface at Kemper's feet.
She cries and looks ahead of her, seeing nothing but
pitch black. More thunder rolls as we suddenly see it
start to rain. Erin runs faster and faster, looking
back every two seconds. As she looks, she sees no one
in sight but herself. The only sounds that can be
heard if the rain falling onto the soft ground. She
looks up and starts to cry.

Suddenly, she trips, sliding into the wet mud. She
stands up and looks around. Nothing but falling rain
surrounds her. She stands up and starts to walk back
towards the van. She walks slowly. No one and nothing
can be seen around her. She gives off a sigh of
relief and continues to walk. The rain begins to pour
harder now. She wipes the mud off of her face and
continues to cry. Another sound of a branch breaking
is heard behind her. She turns around and sees
nothing. She turns back around and continues to walk.
Another noise is heard from behind her.

She turns around again just as the chainsaw lights
up! She screams and runs into the woods. Leatherface
chases after her like a wild animal, waving the
chainsaw in the air like a maniac. She looks back and
sees him coming closer. She stops and looks down to
see Kemper lying face down in the mud. He is not
moving. She cries and continues to run.

		ERIN
SOMEBODY HELP ME!

Erin runs faster and faster until she finally reaches
the

EXT. LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_RAINING_(CONT.)

Erin looks ahead of her to see the van sitting to the
side of the road. She looks back to see Leatherface
still chasing after her, but still very far in the
woods.

EXT. VAN_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_RAINING_(CONT.)

Erin makes her way to the van and slides open the
door. She steps into the van and slides the door
shut.

INT. VAN_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_RAINING_(CONT.)

Erin ducks down and lies down on the mattress. She is
very close to the side of the van. Only the sound of
the rain tapping against the roof can be heard around
her. She squeezes herself and closes her eyes tight.
She starts to cry quietly. She pushes herself into
the back of the van and covers herself with her
hands. She stays silent as the rain continues. We
look around the van from Erin's point of view and
then return to the CAMERA. Erin ducks down more and
continues to cry silently. She wipes her tears and
looks up. Nothing but the rain. She crawls her way to
the side window and slowly looks out of it. There is
no one in sight. Not even Leatherface. She sighs and
leans back down on the mattress.

Suddenly, the buzzing of the chainsaw starts again
and Leatherface can be seen standing outside the
window! Erin screams and covers her eyes as
Leatherface tries to scrape his way into the van with
the chainsaw. Erin looks around and suddenly jumps
into the driver's seat. She looks back and sees
Leatherface still trying to break in. She opens the
driver's door and suddenly falls out of the wet mud.

EXT. VAN_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_RAINING_(CONT.)

Erin stands up and quickly starts to run down the
road. She looks back and sees Leatherface running
after her. She cries and continues to run faster. She
makes her way into the lonely field and runs through
the wet grass. She looks back and sees Leatherface
tearing through the grass with the chainsaw. Erin
runs and runs, and cries and cries. She falls, but
quickly gets back up again. She is very far ahead of
Leatherface, but she can still hear his chainsaw
buzzing in the distance. Erin pushes through the
grass and suddenly sees the old house full of light
in front of her. She screams as Leatherface comes
closer and closer. She starts to run towards the old
house until she is on the

EXT. PORCH_OLD HOUSE_RAINING_(CONT.)

Erin pounds on the door and looks back to see
Leatherface coming closer and closer towards her.

		ERIN
SOMEBODY! PLEASE!

Erin suddenly tears open the door and runs inside,
shutting it tightly and locking it.

INT. HALLWAY_OLD HOUSE_RAINING_(CONT.)

Erin, soaking wet, looks around the house for any
place to hide. No noise is outside but the rain.

		ERIN
Hello? Somebody please help me!

Erin looks around. There is no answer.

		ERIN
PLEASE!

Erin looks ahead and sees the sliding door. She
pounds on it and waits for a response, which she does
not get.

		ERIN
HELLO? SOMEBODY...PLEASE HELP ME!

She pounds on it again, but there is still no answer.
She tries to open it with her bare hands, but can't.
She sighs and tries again. She pulls once more and
the door comes sliding open. She falls to the ground
and looks at the front door, which remains still. She
stands up just as the chainsaw comes running through
the door! Erin screams as the chainsaw tears apart
the front door. She screams again and runs into the
room behind the sliding door. She looks at what's
left of the front door to see Leatherface almost step
inside. She tries to shut the sliding door, but
can't!

		ERIN
COME ON!

The door still won't move, and Leatherface busts down
the door and comes running towards her! She screams
and the door slides shut!

INT. DARK ROOM_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Erin locks the door with three locks that can be seen
all over the sides of the door. She reaches over and
looks into the peephole. From her point of view, we
see nothing but the dead door.

Suddenly, Leatherface's eye comes directly in front
of hers! She screams and comes falling back down the
stairs. She suddenly sits up as she goes sliding into
the dark room, which is full of water. The water is
up to Erin's waist. She cries and stands up. She
looks around to see the other door in the back, and
the door to the left of her, which is closed. She
looks up to see the broken window, which Morgan slid
out of. Rain comes pouring down into the room,
flooding it. She sighs and looks around. She stands
up and slowly starts to walk up towards the door on
the far left. She opens the door quietly and steps
in. She cringes at the bloody hooks. She covers her
nose and looks around. Meat and bones lie everywhere
on the ground. A loud bang is heard above her. She
ducks down and hides behind the door. Footsteps pass
her from the hallway. They disappear and Erin opens
the door slowly. As she looks around, she
sees...MORGAN!

He is lying face down on the floor. She runs over to
him and falls next to him.

		ERIN
Morgan...Morgan, we must get out of here now!

Morgan stands still.

		ERIN
Morgan...?

She reaches out to him and movies his shoulders. He
sits still.

		ERIN
Morgan...Morgan! Get up!

Morgan doesn't move.

		ERIN
Morgan!

Erin moves his body up to see that he is completely
dead! Water flies everywhere as his body falls to the
ground. Erin screams with terror. She stands up and
starts to run towards the door when she suddenly
hears more footsteps making their way towards the
sliding door. Erin turns around and sees the closed
door in the back of the room. She runs towards it and
opens it to find Andy and Pepper's dead bodies! She
screams and slams the door. She panics and suddenly
sees the open window. Why didn't she see it before?
She runs towards it just as the sound of the chainsaw
can be heard tearing at the sliding door. She makes
her way out of the window and goes running away from
the house.

EXT. LONELY FIELD_RAINING_(CONT.)

Erin runs through the long stalks of grass and
continues to look back. We see through her point of
view that Leatherface is coming out of the front
door! She screams as Leatherface runs towards her
very quickly, waving his chainsaw in the air. We cut
back to him and Erin in between shots. Erin screams
while she runs.

		ERIN
SOMEBODY! PLEASE!

The chainsaw grows nearer and nearer towards her. She
screams louder.

		ERIN
HELP ME!

Erin runs faster and faster, and no matter what she
does, Leatherface seems to be coming closer and
closer to her. She falls into the ground and looks
up, seeing the van. She gets up and runs past it and
finally starts to run down the

EXT. LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_RAINING_(CONT.)

In a series of shots, we watch as Erin runs down the
road and makes her way into the woods, followed by
the maniac himself. In a montage of fast moving
clips, we watch Erin runs through the woods,
Leatherface coming after her, and the rain pouring
down on both of them. Erin screams and screams but
nothing seems to help. She stops running and looks
up, seeing a lonely gas station through the trees.
She screams and continues to run towards it.

		ERIN
HELP ME! PLEASE!

Erin suddenly gets caught in the branches, tearing
her shirt and her pants. She screams and tries to get
herself loose. Leatherface comes closer and closer,
waving the chainsaw everywhere. She pulls on her
shirt, which seems to be tearing. She looks back to
see Leatherface comes closer and closer. She tugs on
her shirt as hard as she can and she soon falls to
the ground, her shirt a little torn. She stands up
and starts to run. Leatherface stops at the branches
and cuts through them with the chainsaw. Erin runs
through the trees until she finally reaches the

EXT. GAS STATION_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_RAINING_(CONT.)

As Erin runs, she looks up to see a police car parked
in front of the gas station. Just as she runs towards
it, SHERIFF HOYT, an old man in his very late
fifties, steps out, holding a large mug of coffee.
Erin runs towards him.

		ERIN
PLEASE! PLEASE HELP ME!

		SHERIFF
Whoa, whoa, whoa, little lady.

		ERIN
Please help me!

Erin falls to the ground, he face covered with dirt
and mud.

		SHERIFF
Just slow down and tell me what's wrong.

		ERIN
HE'S KILLING THEM!

		SHERIFF
Who's killing who?

		ERIN
THE MAN...HE'S KILLING MY FRIENDS! PLEASE! HELP ME!

		SHERIFF
Hold on, ma'am. Just calmly tell me what happened.

Sheriff Hoyt helps Erin up, who is not leaning
against the police car, crying.

		SHERIFF
Just tell me what happened, ma'am.

		ERIN
There was a man...and he was killing all my
friends...He was coming after me...With a chainsaw.

		SHERIFF
Oh, come now, miss-

		ERIN
I'M NOT LYING! He's in the woods with a chainsaw! He
killed all of my friends!

		SHERIFF
I'll go take a look.

		ERIN
NO! Please! Please don't leave me!

		SHERIFF
Everything gonna be okay, just hold on a minute.

Sheriff Hoyt walks away as Erin stares at him,
pulling her hair back and wiping her tears. Sheriff
Hoyt walks over into the woods and looks into it. The
rain slowly comes to a stop. Erin sniffles and tries
to help herself from crying. Sheriff Hoyt looks out.
He turns around and heads back towards Erin.

		SHERIFF
There's nobody out there.

		ERIN
But he was chasing me with a chainsaw!

		SHERIFF
I understand that, just let me take you to the
nearest police station and they can sort it out
there, alright?

Erin sniffs and then nods. Sheriff Hoyt opens the car
door for her and she steps in.

		SHERIFF
I'll be right back, okay? You just sit still.

Erin nods and Sheriff Hoyt shuts the door. He looks
at her and then makes his way into the gas station.

INT. POLICE CAR_GAS STATION_(CONT.)

Erin holds herself and looks around. She wipes her
tears and looks outside into the woods. She knows
what she saw, and she knows that no one believes her.
She sets her head down and continues to cry. The gas
station door swings open and Sheriff Hoyt walks out,
followed by HENRIETTA SAWYER, a young girl of about
eighteen. She is very dirty at the moment and holds a
young baby. She talks with Sheriff Hoyt as they both
make their way to the car. Henrietta opens the
passenger's door and steps inside. She looks over at
Erin and smiles. Sheriff Hoyt sits himself down in
the driver's seat. He looks at Erin and smiles again.

		SHERIFF
This is my daughter, Henrietta.

		HENRIETTA
Hello.

		ERIN
(wipes her tears)
Hi...

Henrietta smiles as Sheriff Hoyt starts the car.

EXT. POLICE CAR_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_CONT.)

We watch as the police car makes its way down the
lonely country road.

INT. POLICE CAR_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_(CONT.)

Erin looks outside as Henrietta and Sheriff Hoyt stay
silent. The baby whines and groans.

		SHERIFF
So what brings you all the way out to Travis County,
um...

		ERIN
Erin.

		SHERIFF
Erin.

		ERIN
My friends and I were on our way to Mexico...Then our
van broke down.

		SHERIFF
That's never good, is it?

		ERIN
No...

		SHERIFF
So what happened?

		ERIN
We went looking for help...But we didn't find
anything. Are you taking me to the police station?

		SHERIFF
I just need to make a little stop at our house...You
don't mind, do you?

		ERIN
No...

		SHERIFF
(smiles)
Good.

		HENRIETTA
Do you think that we could have her for dinner?

		SHERIFF
That's up to her, honey. Would you like to join us?

		ERIN
I'd rather just go to the station.

		HENRIETTA
Oh, but you must join us. My uncle makes the best
meat, right, pop?

		SHERIFF
The best in the county.

		ERIN
I just want to go to the station please.

		HENRIETTA
Alright, but you don't know what your missing.

		ERIN
I just want to go home.

		SHERIFF
That's not going to be for a while, darling. So why
don't you just sit back and join us?

		ERIN
I don't know.

		HENRIETTA
Please? For us? We seldom ever get company.

		SHERIFF
Usually we just scare them off, right, sweetie?

		HENRIETTA
That's right.

Sheriff Hoyt and Henrietta smile. Erin leans over
towards the door. She closes her eyes and looks
outside. They pass the van. Erin watches it as it
disappears from behind them. They suddenly take a
sharp turn into the field.

		ERIN
Where are we going?

		HENRIETTA
We told you. Our house, silly!

Erin pants. She pulls her hair back and looks out
into the wet grass.

EXT. POLICE CAR_FIELD_(CONT.)

We watch as the police car makes its way to the same
old house we had seen before. Light surrounds it from
the windows, making it very eerie. We follow the
police car as it suddenly parks in front of the
house.

INT. POLICE CAR_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Erin looks at the house and starts to panic.

		HENRIETTA
Please come on and join us.

		ERIN
No...NO! GET ME OUT OF HERE!

		SHERIFF
Oh come now. Don't be shy.

Suddenly, Sheriff Hoyt grabs Erin and pulls her out
of the police car. She screams and kicks wildly.
Henrietta, who is outside, smiles and watches. She
bounces the baby.

		SHERIFF
Open the front door, will you, honey?

		HENRIETTA
Sure, pop.

EXT. POLICE CAR_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Henrietta makes her way up the stairs and opens the
front door. Erin screams and screams, but nothing can
be done about it. Henrietta looks at the front door,
which is nearly destroyed from the chainsaw.

		HENRIETTA
Hey pop!

		SHERIFF
What is it now?

		HENRIETTA
Look what Bubba did to this door.

Sheriff Hoyt turns around and looks at it.

		SHERIFF
That son of a bitch. When he gets here I'm gonna give
him a piece of my mind!

		HENRIETTA
I'll go get grandpa.

Henrietta walks into the house as Sheriff Hoyt
carries the screaming Erin up to the porch.

		SHERIFF
No why are you screaming? I promise you, we're gonna
have some fun!

Erin screams as we watch them both go into the house.
As they walk inside, it begins to rain again.

INT. HALLWAY_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Sheriff Hoyt walks in the house with Erin while
Henrietta makes her way up the stairs.

		HENRIETTA
Grandpa!

INT. LIVING ROOM_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Sheriff Hoyt walks into the very dirty living room
and sets Erin down on the couch.

		SHERIFF
Jedidiah!

Sheriff Hoyt smiles at Erin as he covers her mouth. A
very young boy, JEDIDIAH SAWYER, runs down the stairs
and into the living room, joining his father. He is a
boy of about six or seven.

		JEDIDIAH
Yes, pop?

		SHERIFF
Go get some rope for our new friend here.

		JEDIDIAH
Alright.

Jedidiah runs out of the living room and into the
kitchen. Sheriff Hoyt smiles at Erin, who starts to
cry.

		SHERIFF
Now don't you worry. Everything's gonna be okay.

Erin closes her eyes and tries to scream. Jedidiah
runs into the living room with a long stretch of
rope.

		SHERIFF
Thank you, son. Now go fix up the dinner table.

Jedidiah runs into the kitchen and runs into the
dining room, his hands full of plates. Sheriff Hoyt
grabs Erin's arms and ties them up, letting go of her
mouth. She screams horribly. Henrietta walks into the
living room and sticks a dirty sock in her mouth.

		SHERIFF
Thank you, honey. Now where's your grandfather?

		HENRIETTA
He's coming, He just needs a little help coming down
the stairs.

Sheriff Hoyt laughs as Erin accidentally spits out
the sock. Sheriff Hoyt smiles and grabs her face.

		SHERIFF
You simmer down, now.

		ERIN
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE!?

		SHERIFF
Just stay quiet now. And don't move a muscle.

Sheriff Hoyt picks up the sock and stuffs it into her
mouth again. Erin's muffled screams can barley be
heard. A single tear rolls down her cheek. Sheriff
Hoyt smiles and stands up, leaving Erin alone on the
dirty couch. Just then, Leatherface walks into the
house. Sheriff Hoyt walks over to him.

		SHERIFF
What the hell did you do to this door!?

Leatherface says nothing but starts to cry and wail.

		SHERIFF
NOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GET ANOTHER DOOR! YOU DAMN
FOOL!

Sheriff Hoyt smacks Leatherface, who makes his way
down the hall. Sheriff Hoyt follows him as we stay on
Erin, who cries and tries to scream.

EXT. OLD HOUSE_FIELD_RAINING_(CONT.)

From a high angle, we watch the lit up house as the
rain starts to pour even harder. Thunder rumbles and
lightning strikes.

INT. LIVING ROOM_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Erin lies on the couch without moving. Suddenly, she
turns to see Jane walk into the living room! She
smiles and walks over to Erin. Erin moves and moves,
trying to break free from the ropes.

		JANE
DAD! What should I do with the girl?

A few seconds pass, then Sheriff Hoyt walks in the
room and looks at Erin.

		SHERIFF
Take her to the dining room. Your grandfather is
getting a little hungry.

Sheriff Hoyt smiles as Jane grabs Erin by the feet
and drags her on the floor into the hallway.

INT. HALLWAY_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Jane continues to drag Erin across the hall until she
makes her way into the

INT. DINING ROOM_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

The table is completely set, and very nice, too. One
extra chair has been added to the front of the table.
Jane picks up Erin and sets her down into it. She
looks at her.

		JANE
Car trouble?

Jane laughs as we hear Erin's muffled cries.

		JANE
Jedidiah! Get in here!

Jedidiah comes running in through the kitchen door.

		JEDIDIAH
What?

		JANE
Do me a big favor and get some more rope, please?

		JEDIDIAH
Why do I always have to get the rope?

		SHERIFF
(from hallway)
Do what your sister tells you.

Jedidiah stomps off into the kitchen while Jane tends
to Erin.

		JANE
Where are your car keys? Couldn't find them, could
you?

From behind, Sheriff Hoyt steps into the dining room.
Jane doesn't notice.

		JANE
(holds keys in air)
You're never gonna get 'em back either!

Sheriff Hoyt grabs them and stuffs them into his
pocket. Jane turns around.

		JANE
Daddy!

		SHERIFF
Jane, now I told you, you cannot keep taking things
from a person, that's just not right!

		JANE
But, dad, I was just-

		SHERIFF
Don't but dad me. Now go downstairs and get those
other kids for dinner.

Jane nods and walks out of the dining room. Sheriff
Hoyt leans over towards Erin.

		SHERIFF
Daughters. What can you do?

Erin closes her eyes tight as a slight tear rolls
down her cheek.

		SHERIFF
Now don't you worry. Everything's gonna be okay.

Sheriff Hoyt pulls back Erin's hair and smiles at
her. Jedidiah steps in from the kitchen, holding the
rope.

		SHERIFF
Give it here, son.

Jedidiah hands the rope to his father and then steps
back into the kitchen, joining Henrietta.

		SHERIFF
Now, just stay still.

Erin kicks as Sheriff Hoyt tries to tie her feet to
the chair. He looks up to Erin and gives her a death
stare.

		SHERIFF
Just stay still.

Sheriff Hoyt tries to do it again, but Erin continues
to kick and scream. He sits up and slaps her. Her
head goes falling back.

		SHERIFF
I told you to stay still!

Erin breathes hard as Sheriff Hoyt comes back down
and ties her feet to the chair. He sits up and wipes
his hands.

		SHERIFF
That's a good girl.

Erin tries to kick and scream but we only hear her
muffled cries. Erin looks up and sees Drayton wheel
himself into the dining room. Erin looks up as
Drayton makes his way to the side of the table, next
to Erin. Leatherface makes his way into the room from
the hallway. He joins Drayton at the table. Sheriff
Hoyt walks into the room, holding a small
pocketknife. Sheriff Hoyt smiles and makes his way
over towards Erin. Henrietta and Jedidiah follow
them.

		SHERIFF
Now this will only hurt for a second.

Sheriff Hoyt unties Erin's hands and grabs one of
Erin's fingers. He brings the knife closer and closer
towards her finger. Everyone laughs and smiles.
Leatherface jumps up with excitement. Soon, the blade
comes down and cuts Erin's finger! She groans and
closes her eyes tight. Sheriff Hoyt holds her finger
and brings it close to Drayton.

		SHERIFF
You were hungry, weren't you, Grandpa?

Drayton smiles as Erin's finger comes closer and
closer to his mouth. Soon, her finger is in Drayton's
mouth. He sucks on the blood for a long time. Erin
leans her head back and continues to moan and scream.
Everyone laughs and leans their heads back.
Leatherface jumps up and down and claps his hands
together. From Erin's point of view, we see
everything slowly fade out and the laughter continue
in the background. We slowly fade to a white screen
and then

FLASH CUT TO:

A DARK SCREEN.

Then, the sliding door opens, and we suddenly find
ourselves in the

INT. DARK ROOM_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

The sliding door opens and we see Leatherface holding
Erin by the waist. The ropes are off of her, and the
sock is out of her mouth. She screams as Leatherface
throws her down into the dark room. Erin goes
toppling down the stairs and suddenly falls onto the
ground. The room becomes dark after Leatherface slams
the skidding door shut. A small light can be seen
spreading across Erin's closed eyes. We pan closer
and closer towards her closed eye until it suddenly
opens. She sits up and looks at the supposedly open
window. As she looks over to it, she sees that wooden
planks have covered it up. She sighs and looks at her
finger. A small amount of blood pours from it. She
cries and closes her eyes. She looks around and sees
the closed door to the left. She stands up and opens
it, almost running smack into one of the hooks. She
turns around and shuts the door. As she looks around,
she sees Kemper's body lying face down on the ground,
his arms outstretched. She cries and sits down next
to him. She takes him and holds him tight. Soon, he
slowly moves. He isn't dead! Erin looks at his face.
His eyes slowly open and Erin smiles happily.


		ERIN
Kemper! Kemper!

		KEMPER
Where the hell are we...

		ERIN
Kemper, we have to get the fuck out of here now!

		KEMPER
I can barley move...

		ERIN
I'll help you, just get up! We need to leave, now!

Kemper tries to stand up, but quickly falls to his
knees.

		ERIN
Oh, god, Kemper...

		KEMPER
I can't walk...

Erin looks around, but sees nothing that can help
Kemper.

		ERIN
SHIT!

Footsteps can be heard above them. They both stay
silent as the footsteps continue to be heard. From
above, we hear Sheriff Hoyt screaming at someone. It
slowly fades out and Erin turns back to Kemper.

		ERIN
We need to get you out of here...

		KEMPER
How?

		ERIN
I don't know...There's no way except for the front...

		KEMPER
Shit...

Kemper can barely talk. He sighs and closes his eyes.

		ERIN
Kemper, no! Just stay with me, okay? You're not going
to leave me! Just stay the fuck awake!

		KEMPER
I can try but I doubt anything will happen...I can't
feel my legs...

Erin pulls her hair back and starts to cry.

		ERIN
Shit...

Erin stands up and looks around. She opens the door
and looks around for anything to break the wooden
boards from the window. She finally finds a large
hook and runs over to the window with it. She jabs it
into the crack of the boards and tries and pull at it
hard. The boards do not come loose.

		ERIN
SHIT!

Erin throws down the hook and looks on the table for
anything else she can find. She spots a hammer and
grabs it. She runs back over to the window and slams
the hammer on top of the boards. One of the boards
suddenly come loose. She tugs on the board and it
comes falling down to the floor. Two more are left,
but it's still a small space. She smiles and does the
same with the other boards. One of them comes falling
down. There is one more left at the bottom of it. She
sticks the hammer into it and it suddenly comes
loose! She grabs it and throws it down, along with
the hammer. She smiles and runs over to the dark
room. She leans over to Kemper, whose eyes are half
closed.

		ERIN
Kemper, I found a way out, but you need to stand up.
You need to help me.

		KEMPER
I can try...

Erin picks him up and they both make their way
towards the window. He looks up and groans.

		KEMPER
I can't do this...

		ERIN
Kemper, don't do this! We need to get out of here
now!

Suddenly, there are many footsteps above them. Erin
pulls Kemper up towards the window.

		ERIN
COME ON!

Kemper finally makes his way through the window. Erin
pushes him out of the window. She looks back and
hears the sliding door open.

		ERIN
Oh, shit...

Erin jumps up and pushes herself through the window.
We watch as Sheriff Hoyt runs down the stairs. He
sees her and runs towards her. She is almost out the
window.

		SHERIFF
Henrietta! GET IN HERE NOW!

Sheriff Hoyt reaches for her feet but misses just as
she makes her way out of the window.

		SHERIFF
Damnitt!

Sheriff Hoyt runs up the stairs.

EXT. BACKYARD_OLD HOUSE_RAINING_(CONT.)

Erin and Kemper lie down on the wet ground. Erin
stands up and grabs Kemper by the waist.

		ERIN
WE NEED TO GO!

Erin grabs Kemper and they start to run into the
field.

INT. HALLWAY_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Sheriff Hoyt runs through the sliding door and looks
around. He makes his way into the kitchen and comes
back out holding a rifle.

		SHERIFF
Henrietta! Stay in here with your brother! I'm gonna
bring home the dinner...

Sheriff Hoyt runs past the CAMERA and runs through
the front door.

EXT. FIELD_OLD HOUSE_RAINING_(CONT.)

Erin still holds Kemper, who can barely walk, but
they are somewhat far away from the house. Sheriff
Hoyt runs out and stands at the porch. The rain
continues to fall.

		SHERIFF
GET BACK HERE!

Sheriff Hoyt fires a shot into the air. Erin and
Kemper duck. They both stand up and continue to try
and run. Sheriff Hoyt runs towards the police car and
steps inside. He starts it up and drives after them.
Erin and Kemper fall down into the field, and the
police car drives right past them. Sheriff Hoyt did
not see them.

		KEMPER
WHAT THE FUCK DO WE DO-

		ERIN
Just stay down...We're going to get the hell out of
here.

		JANE
(O.S.)
Hell no you're not.

They both look up to see Jane standing still,
smiling. She reaches down and grabs both of them by
the shoulders.

		JANE
HEY, POP!

The police car stops and turns around, the headlights
flashing on Erin and Kemper.

		JANE
I got 'em!

		ERIN
NO! LET ME GO!

		JANE
You want him, pop?

Sheriff Hoyt sticks his head out of the window and
smiles.

		SHERIFF
Drop the boy.

Jane drops him and the police car zooms towards his
body.

		ERIN
No!

Jane grabs Erin and runs back into the house. Kemper
looks up as the headlights come closer and closer to
him. From Kemper's point of view, we watch until the
headlights cover the entire screen. We watch as Jane
and Erin run back into the house. Kemper's screams
can be heard in the background.

		ERIN
(O.S.)
NO!

Sheriff Hoyt laughs as he drives back towards the
house.

INT. HALLWAY_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Jane holds Erin and drags her into the dining room.
She kicks and screams wildly but cannot get loose.

INT. DINING ROOM_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Jane sets Erin in the seat and grabs a piece of rope.
Erin suddenly runs out of the chair and runs out of
the dining room!

		JANE
WHERE THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING?

INT. HALLWAY_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Erin runs towards the front door and stops right in
her tracks as Sheriff Hoyt stands in front of her.

		SHERIFF
You're not going anywhere.

He laughs as Erin turns around to see Jane,
Henrietta, Jedidiah, Drayton, and Leatherface
standing there. They all laugh as Erin back away. She
looks up and starts to run up the stairs.

		SHERIFF
FOLLOW HER YOU FOOL!

Leatherface runs up the stairs, screaming.

INT. UPSTAIRS_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Erin looks around and makes her way into an old room.

INT. OLD ROOM_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

Erin runs inside and shuts the door. She locks it and
looks around. There is nothing in the room except
feathers lying all over the place and old bones. A
loud bang can be heard behind her. Leatherface is
trying to get in. She looks around and sees a closed
glass window. She looks at the door and then back at
the window. She runs towards the window and breaks
through it!

EXT. BACKYARD_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

We watch as Erin comes flying through the window in
slow motion. She screams as she comes falling down on
all the wet sheets. She stays till for a second...Is
she dead? Suddenly, she moves and looks up. The
window is completely broken. She stands up and runs
over to the front of the house. She stops and ducks
as she sees Sheriff Hoyt running towards his car.

		SHERIFF
I'll be back! You get her, do you hear me!?

Erin stays silent until the police car drives off.
She stands up and runs into the backyard. She looks
around and sees the old cars. She runs over towards
them and opens the door to an old truck.

INT. TRUCK_BACKYARD_OLD HOUSE_RAINING_(CONT.)

Erin falls to the ground of the truck and stays
completely silent. She breathes deep and watches as
the rain continues to pound hard on the glass
windshield. She breathes hard and closes her eyes
tight. She looks around at the dark truck. Noises can
be heard from outside. She starts to sit up and looks
out the window. Nothing seems to be wrong. She starts
to open the door when suddenly Leatherface appears
from outside the window! Erin screams and steps back.
Leatherface holds the large chainsaw and jabs at the
large door. She steps back and makes her way to the
driver's door. She tries to open it, but it seems to
be stuck!

		ERIN
OH, GOD, NO!

The chainsaw continues as Erin tries harder and
harder to open the door. Finally, it busts open and
she steps out.

EXT. TRUCK_BACKYARD_OLD HOUSE_RAINING_(CONT.)

Erin runs back towards the house and looks back to
see Leatherface chasing after her! She turns the
corner to the house and makes her way towards the
field.

EXT. FIELD_RAINING_(CONT.)

Erin screams and runs faster and faster into the
field. She looks back and sees Leatherface running
towards her, not stopping. She cries and cries, but
nothing is helping.

		ERIN
SOMEBODY HELP ME!

She screams and runs into the field until she can
barely see the house anymore. She looks around and
sees that she can no longer see or hear Leatherface
or his chainsaw. She stops and looks around. She
starts to walk slower into the field. She looks back
and starts to run again.

INT. POLICE CAR_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_RAINING_ (CONT.)

Sheriff Hoyt drives faster and faster into the road.
He looks around and sighs deeply. An angry frown
spreads across his face.

EXT. VAN_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_RAINING_(CONT.)

Erin can be seen running through the field and stops,
out of breath. She looks up and sees the van. She
runs towards it and slides open the wet door. She
steps in, shuts the door, and locks it.

INT. VAN_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_RAINING_(CONT.)

Erin leans over to the mattress and cries into it.
She bangs on the side of the door in guilt. She leans
down and presses her back against the door. Suddenly,
a loud bang can be heard behind her. She jumps and
leans back over to the mattress. She cries as
Leatherface tries to get in the van with the
chainsaw. She cries and cries and covers her ears.
Sparks fly as the chainsaw almost opens the door. As
they do, Erin covers her ears and cries. She turns
and opens the driver's door and runs out, not
shutting it behind her.

EXT. LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_RAINING_(CONT.)

Erin runs down the road, followed by a far away
Leatherface. She continues to scream and run down the
road. She runs down the road more and more until she
sees a small car parked on the side of the road. She
runs towards the car and continues to look back.
Leatherface is far away, but is coming closer and
closer towards her.

		ERIN
HELP ME!

INT. CAR_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_RAINING_(CONT.)

Inside, an old chubby woman of about forty-five sits
in the driver's seat, smoking a cigarette and tuning
the radio. Suddenly, Erin bashes on the side of the
passenger's window. The woman jumps and sees her.

		ERIN
PLEASE! OPEN THE DOOR!

		WOMAN
(trying to calm her down)
Alright, alright!

The woman opens the door and Erin steps inside and
slams the door. She locks it quickly.

		WOMAN
What happen-

		ERIN
Just go! Please!

		WOMAN
What's the hurry?

		ERIN
DRIVE! PLEASE!

The woman looks at Erin and then starts the car.

EXT. CAR_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_RAINING_(CONT.)

The car goes zooming down the road just as
Leatherface approaches it. It zooms down until it
becomes a small speck. Leatherface screams and waves
the chainsaw in the air.

INT. CAR_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_RAINING_(CONT.)

Erin looks back and watches at Leatherface becomes a
small speck. She turns back and looks ahead at the
road. The woman sits still and drives. She wears very
thick glasses and dark lipstick.

		WOMAN
What was going on with you back there?

		ERIN
(trying not to cry)
It's a long story, I just want to go home.

		WOMAN
How about the nearest police station?

		ERIN
I dunno...

		WOMAN
I have a house just a little further up here. You can
rest there for a second while I call the police. Does
that sound alright?

Erin nods. There is silence after that.

		ERIN
Thanks...for the ride...

		WOMAN
I always try to help someone. It's my job.

The woman smiles and Erin half smiles. She looks out
the window and covers her forehead. She is trying
hard not to cry.

		WOMAN
It's alright, dear. You can just tell me everything
that happened when we get to the house.

		ERIN
How much longer is it?

		WOMAN
Just a few minutes. You know not many people live out
here. It's just like our own little town. There's so
little of what you can do.

Erin stays silent and listens.

		WOMAN
I can't even imagine what happened to you...But I
promise you that I will take care of you.

Erin nods and closes her eyes. She cries silently and
breathes deep.

EXT. CAR_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_RAINING (CONT.)

We watch as the car makes its way closer towards a
small house on a hill. Lights from inside of it blare
on. The car suddenly turns a corner and we watch as
it finally makes it way to the house.

INT. HOUSE_RAINING_(CONT.)

The woman and Erin walk inside the house quietly.
Erin looks around to see that the house is very warm
and cozy. Different kinds of sculptures are
everywhere. A warm fire burns in the corner in a
furnace. Erin runs over it and warms herself up.

		WOMAN
Oh, dear, come back here, I'll get you a warm
blanket. Would you like some tea?

		ERIN
No...No thank you...

The woman nods and disappears into the back of the
house. Erin turns back towards the furnace and warms
herself up. She starts to cry silently. The woman
comes back and wraps the blanket around Erin's
shoulders. She then walks over to a large rocking
chair and sits in it, grabbing a ball of yarn and
some needles. Erin looks at her and then back at the
furnace.

		WOMAN
Do you mind telling me why you were out here in the
rain? And alone, no less! Why if I was stuck out
there I'd at least bring a friend.

Erin stays silent. She looks at the woman and then at
the furnace. She looks down and wipes her tears.

We fade to a clock, which moves from one time to a
half of an hour later. The CAMERA turns back to Erin,
who still lies down on the floor. The woman shakes
her head.

		WOMAN
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

Erin looks down and looks at the furnace.

		WOMAN
That is just unbelievable. How could something like
that happen to such a nice and pretty girl like you?

Erin stays silent.

		WOMAN
Oh...my, my, my, my my...Are you sure you wouldn't
like any tea? I make the best tea in the county.

		ERIN
I...I just want to go home.

		WOMAN
I understand. You can stay here until I get you to
the nearest police station. I'm going to call the
police. Just wait here.

The woman stands up and makes her way into the next
room. Erin sighs and leans over to the floor. She
closes her eyes and falls asleep on the floor. The
woman returns later to see her on the floor. The
woman smiles and sits back down in her chair.

EXT. LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_RAINING_(CONT.)

We watch as a familiar police car makes its way
towards the tea lady's house.

INT. HOUSE_RAINING_(CONT.)

Erin stays silent, sleeping on the floor. A loud
knock can be heard from behind the front door. The
tea lady comes out from behind a door and makes her
way towards the front door. She looks at Erin, who
stays silent. The tea lady opens the door and the
CAMERA zooms in on

SHERIFF HOYT!

He smiles and takes his hat off to the tea lady.

		SHERIFF
Hello, Kathryn. How are you this evening?

		WOMAN
I'm just fine, Sheriff. She's right in here if you
follow me.

The woman shuts the door and Sheriff Hoyt makes his
way towards the living room, where Erin continues to
sleep. From the point of view of Erin, we watch as
she slowly opens her eyes to see Sheriff Hoyt
standing up looking down at her.

		SHERIFF
Hello, little lady.

Erin stands up and screams. She slowly makes her way
to the corner of the room.

		SHERIFF
Now hold on, now. You get your ass back here right
now!

		ERIN
No...NO!

Erin screams and runs through the house into the

INT. HALLWAY_HOUSE_(CONT.)

She runs through the hallway, looking around for a
place to hide. She turns and sees an opens door
leading into an empty room. She runs into it and
slams the door in front of the CAMERA.

INT. BEDROOM_HOUSE_(CONT.)

Erin looks around and tries to lock it, but there is
no lock! She cries and falls onto the ground.
Footsteps can be heard from the hallway. She cries
and crawls towards the corner. Slowly, the door
opens, and Sheriff Hoyt stands there with the tea
lady. He smiles and wags his pointer finger at her.

		SHERIFF
You naughty girl. You get back here right now!

Erin screams as Sheriff Hoyt grabs her and covers his
hand over her mouth. She screams and kicks wildly and
we watch as they all walk out of the room. The woman
shuts the door quietly.

INT. LIVING ROOM_HOUSE_(CONT.)

Sheriff Hoyt holds Erin who continues to scream while
the tea lady opens the front door for them.

		SHERIFF
Thank you again, Kathryn.

		WOMAN
Oh, it's my pleasure, Sheriff Hoyt. Come back
sometime and have a cup of tea!

		SHERIFF
You know I will!

		WOMAN
Goodbye!

Sheriff and Erin run through the door while the tea
lady shuts it. She smiles and starts to hum.

EXT. POLICE CAR_HOUSE_RAINING_(CONT.)

Sheriff Hoyt still holds Erin will all his might as
she continues to kick and scream. He opens the police
car door and throws her inside. She tries to open it
to get out but can't. Sheriff Hoyt laughs and makes
his way to the driver's seat. He steps inside and
shuts the door.

INT. POLICE CAR_HOUSE_RAINING_(CONT.)

Sheriff Hoyt smiles as Erin tries to open the door.
She pounds on it and screams wildly.

		SHERIFF
Now you shut the fuck up before I go back there and
teach you a lesson you'll never forget!

		Erin
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS!?

		SHERIFF
That's for you to decide. You see, I don't make the
rules. I just follow them!

Erin screams and kicks at the door. Nothing helps.
Sheriff Hoyt starts the car and laughs at Erin, who
continues to scream and kick wildly.

EXT. POLICE CAR_HOUSE_RAINING_(CONT.)

We watch as Erin pounds on the window and the car
drives off into the lonely country road.

EXT. OLD HOUSE_RAINING_LATER

The police car is already parked outside and the rain
continues to pour down faster and faster.

INT. DINING ROOM_OLD HOUSE_(CONT.)

The dining room in empty, and the only person at the
table is Erin, who sits in front of the table, all
tied up with tape over her mouth. Her eyes are
closed, and her head is moving back and forth. She
slowly opens her eyes and looks around. She starts to
scream but we can only hear her muffled cries.

From the kitchen door, Jedidiah walks in with a large
stick. He walks over to Erin and smiles. Erin starts
to cry. Jedidiah smiles once again and starts to poke
Erin with the stick. She cries and Jedidiah starts to
laugh. Then, he starts to hit her. A large tear rolls
down her cheek. Jedidiah stops poking and hitting her
and drops the stick. He looks down and sees Erin's
belly button piercing. He looks at it and touched it
with his finger. He doesn't say a word but smiles.

		JEDIDIAH
Hey pop!

From the kitchen door comes Sheriff Hoyt, wiping his
bloody hands with a cloth. He smiles to his son and
walks over towards him.

		SHERIFF
What is it, son?

		JEDIDIAH
Look!

He points to the piercing and Sheriff Hoyt reaches
his finger at it. Erin starts to cry.

		SHERIFF
Oh my! This is some hole you got there!

Suddenly, Sheriff Hoyt starts to tug at it! Erin
closes her eyes and cries more. We hear her muffled
cries from behind the tape. Sheriff Hoyt pulls harder
and harder on it, until it almost looks like it is
about to rip off. Jedidiah smiles and so does Sheriff
Hoyt. Erin cries as Sheriff Hoyt lets it go. Erin's
sighs can be heard from behind the tape.

Sheriff Hoyt stands up and puts his arms to his
sides.

		SHERIFF
Now what are we going to do with you?

		JEDIDIAH
Oh please pop can I play with her!?

		SHERIFF
No, son! She's our guest! And she hasn't even had the
proper dinner yet!

Erin shakes her hand and cries more as she tries to
escape the clutches of the rope.

		JEDIDIAH
Hey! Why don't we go get grandpa! He'll know what to
do!

		SHERIFF
Great idea, Jedidiah! (to Erin) Grandpa's the best
damn killer in the entire county! He'll know exactly
how to handle you!

Erin screams as Jedidiah and Sheriff Hoyt make their
way back inside the kitchen. Moments pass, and we see
Sheriff Hoyt roll Drayton in from his wheelchair.
Jedidiah, Henrietta, the baby in her clutches, Jane,
and Leatherface, who wears a new mask, follow them
all. This time, it is more like a woman's face.
Makeup covers it entirely. Jedidiah carries a very
large silver bucket. It is bigger then him. He sets
it down on the floor and Sheriff Hoyt unties Erin. He
pulls the tape off of her mouth. She tries to escape,
but is stopped by Henrietta.

		HENRIETTA
Oh no you don't! I got her pop!

Sheriff Hoyt grabs her by the neck and pulls her face
towards the empty bucket.

		SHERIFF
Jedidiah, go get the hammer from the kitchen!
Grandpa's going to do a little killing tonight!

Jedidiah nods and runs into the kitchen. Leatherface
jumps up and down with excitement. Moments pass and
Jedidiah runs in with the hammer. He hands it to
Drayton.

		SHERIFF
Now remember, grandpa, hit her hard.

		DRAYTON
I know what I'm doing you fool!

Sheriff holds Erin head into the bucket, his hand
covering her mouth. She can't scream. Drayton raises
the hammer in the air and swings it down towards
Erin, but misses. The hammer falls into the bucket.

		JANE
Just try again, grandpa!

Jane hands the hammer to Drayton, who nods. The
hammer wiggles from side to side from Drayton's
shaking hands. They all laugh and jump up with
excitement.

		SHERIFF
Hit her, grandpa! Hit her!

Drayton raises the hammer once again, but misses
again. It falls into the bucket. Sheriff Hoyt let's
go of Erin's mouth and grabs the hammer. She screams
loudly.

		ERIN
NO! PLEASE!

		SHERIFF
Hit her hard, grandpa!

		DRAYTON
I know what I'm doing!

		JANE
No you're not! Let's me do it!

		HENRIETTA
No let me do it!

		JEDIDIAH
I never get to hit anyone! Please, daddy! Please!

They all argue and fight over the hammer. Sheriff
Hoyt let's go of Erin, who stands still for a second,
and then looks up to see a window in the dining room.
She stands up and runs towards it! Everyone watches
as she busts through the glass!

EXT. OLD HOUSE_SUNRISE_(CONT.)

The rain has stopped, and Erin lies face first in the
wet mud. She stands up and looks back to see the
white curtains from the broken window sway back and
forth. She stands up and runs into the field. We
watch her as she disappears. We look back at the
porch to see the door swing open, and Sheriff Hoyt
stands there. He starts to run after her, followed by
Leatherface, who holds the wild chainsaw. He turns it
on and follows Sheriff Hoyt down into the field.

EXT. FIELD_LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_(CONT.)

Erin screams and cries as she looks back to see
Sheriff Hoyt and Leatherface running after her from a
far away distance. The sun sets behind the house.

EXT. LONELY COUNTRY ROAD_SUNRISE_(CONT.)

It is very quiet. Soon, Erin runs into the road
through the field and starts to run down the road.
She looks back and sees Sheriff Hoyt running directly
after her! She screams and watches as Leatherface
rises from the field, cutting the grass with the mad
chainsaw. She looks back to see a large red truck
making its way towards her! She steps in front of it
and waves her hands.

		ERIN
PLEASE! HELP ME!

The truck comes to a stop and Erin runs to the side
of the truck. She tries to open the door, but can't!

		ERIN
NO!

Leatherface catches up with Sheriff Hoyt, who stops
running and looks up and Leatherface and Erin.

		SHERIFF
GET HER, LEATHER! GET HER!

Erin runs down the road, followed by the truck
driver, who steps out of the truck with a large
hammer. Erin and the truck driver run down the road,
followed by an angry Leatherface. The truck driver
stops and looks back at Leatherface. He throws the
large hammer at his head and watches as he falls to
the ground. The chainsaw falls onto Leatherface's
leg, cutting into the flesh! He screams and stands
up, running after the truck driver. He catches up to
him and cuts through his stomach! Blood falls
everywhere! Erin looks back and screams!

		ERIN
NO!

Leatherface lets the truck driver's body fall to the
ground. He looks up and chases after Erin, who
screams madly! She looks back to see a small truck
making its way towards her! She smiles but continues
to scream.

		ERIN
PLEASE! STOP!

The truck stops, and Erin climbs into the back of it,
followed by Leatherface, who tries to catch her, but
can't. Erin pounds on the outside window of the truck
while she still sits in the back of it.

		ERIN
GO! GO!

The truck drives faster and faster into the sunrise.
Erin screams and laughs at the same time. She smiles
and watches as Leatherface becomes a small speck. As
we go back to Leatherface, who stands in the road, he
screams and waves the chainsaw in the air! He screams
and screams and screams. The chainsaw waving through
the air madly. He screams once more and we

CUT TO BLACK.

INT. OBSERVATION ROOM_TRAVIS COUNTY POLICE
STATION_(CONT.)

Erin sits still, and the policeman stops the tape
recorder. He sighs and stands up.

		POLICEMAN
Thank you, Erin. A policeman will be taking you home
shortly.

Erin nods and watches as the policeman walks out of
the room. She stays silent, and then screams wildly.

INT. HALLWAY_(CONT.)

The policeman stands in front of the hallway, holding
the tape recorder. The second policeman walks up to
him.

		POLICEMAN #2
That took longer than expected. Did she talk?

		POLICEMAN
Oh yeah, and I got the whole thing on tape. Take this
to Officer Hooper please.

The policeman hands the tape recorder to the second
policeman, who runs down the hallway. The policeman
stands still and covers his forehead.

I need someone to take this girl home. Any
volunteers?

(O.S.)
I'll do it, sir.

		VOICE
(O.S.)
Oh I will, sir.

SHERIFF HOYT!

He smiles and walks towards the room.

		SHERIFF
Oh believe me...I will.

He smiles once more and walks inside the room,
letting the door slam in front of the CAMERA.
